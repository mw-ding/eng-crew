"""`mdstack watch` is the zero-token watcher that queues wakes in `wake/queue.jsonl` (one-shot `--source` commands cut off
at `--source-timeout`, default 60 s, queue growth from another poller, and an `ask:`
wake at each open owner ask's deadline in `asks/<n>.json`; a signal during a scan is held until its children exit)
and retries pending lead demand after 60, 120, 240, 480, then every 900 s while it is unchanged (a changed pending set
restarts at 60 s; a lead's acknowledged `waiting:` owner, hold or CI id is never retried until its PR's poll-state,
hold, owner answers or ask change, which wakes it on that scan; an acknowledged admission deferral also gets a 60 s
`admission recheck` that types only once its ref is admissible, #1715), then exits with one reason line; runs without `start` skip liveness
wakes while their record mtime is less than 60 s
old. Verified panes with a live tool session or recent output get a supervisor heartbeat instead of a stale wake; a
working run whose tmux pane printed nothing for `--idle-stall` (default 1800 s) is idle at its prompt and wakes stale with
liveness `idle` even while its claim or status file keeps being refreshed (#1283). An alive builder holding acked
unfinished work whose claim heartbeat is older than 900 s wakes stale with liveness `claim` for its lead, however fresh
the supervisor heartbeat on its status file, unless its item is held or its harness is mid-turn (#1633). Each new stale wake opens a stall
in `metrics/observations.jsonl` keyed by run, and that run's next status line closes it (self-improve.md, #1524).
Each live run's screen is matched against its harness adapter's transient-error text; each new match is a line in
`schedule/errors.jsonl` (docs/scheduling.md#inputs). A run whose harness shows its adapter's usage-limit line probes
`quota` and wakes once per run as `quota` (action restart: `mdstack restart` moves it to the next eligible engine, #631;
escalate after its one restart). Finishing work deferred by the scheduler past `stuck_after` is one
`schedule-stuck` wake per (pool, ref, first deferral), and the exit line is followed by `mdstack schedule summary`'s line
(docs/scheduling.md#observability).
While the project is paused (`pause.json`, mdstack pause, #1714) the watcher only observes: each scan runs the sources
and queues their events, but runs no status or liveness scan, role-host pull, timer, routine, scale-down, route,
backstop or nudge, and a one-shot watcher does not exit; status lines wait at their offsets until mdstack resume.
Its `wake: watcher` line is never typed into a window 0 showing a dialog, which gets
a `dialog` wake instead (#315). Before a coordinator wake, `mdstack route` consumes mechanical records;
the watcher continues scanning when none of the new records need judgement (#434); a record route keeps with
added notes (`consumer`, `dependents`, `route_error`) still counts as one that does (#814).
A source cut off at its timeout or exiting 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL, a transient `mdstack poll` failure) is a line in
`wake/incidents.jsonl`, not a wake; `--source-failures` consecutive ones send one `source-failing` wake with the count.
The `--source` commands run at most once per `--source-interval` (default `runtime.options.poll_interval`, 60 s), not on
every `--interval` scan, and the next due time survives a re-arm; an exit-75 line `rate-limited until <UTC>` holds them
until that reset, at most an hour, so watchers sharing one GitHub login stop spending its quota (#1300).
When `cli/mdstack`, `crew.d/*.py` or a `crew-*.py` module change on disk, the watcher re-execs itself before it queues or
routes that scan's wakes, so new code resolves any new profile keys (#702).
A run on a role host gets no liveness wake from this primary's tmux; every `runtime.options.host_scan_interval`
(default 15 s) one `pull` per role host with runs copies their new status lines into the primary's status mirrors,
which wake as local lines do; the host's answer is kept under `pulls` in watch-state.json (#346). Pulls failing 3 scans
in a row make the host's runs `unreachable`: one `unreachable` escalate wake per outage past --stale, then a `reconcile`
wake when it answers again, with a restart wake for each run found dead or missing; a tombstoned run (an owner's
abandon) is stopped on its host then (#347).
Once another runtime owns the repo (ownership `lost`, after a handoff's ack) the watcher refuses to arm (prompt stop).
With `[triage] enabled`, each scan runs the triage sweep timer, which costs no model turn and queues no wake
(docs/triage.md#triggers-and-cadence, #748); a newly closed milestone makes a sweep due at once (#374).
With `[docs] enabled`, each scan runs the docs-pass timer: the zero-model docs scan, then a docs-pass researcher session
only when the scan changed since the last report (docs/project-docs.md#docs-pass, #1026).
With `[reflection] enabled`, each scan runs the reflection timer (`mdstack reflection`'s tick): weekly and
milestone-close windows into a persistent ledger, one researcher reflection run at a time (docs/self-improve.md#reflection,
#1521).
Each scan also scales idle lifecycle role instances down to their min (`mdstack up`'s scale_down, #1231) and runs due
role routines (`mdstack up`'s routine_tick, #1247); the triage, docs and backstop timers take their cadence from the
researcher's and coordinator's routine files (docs/routines.md#terminal).
While every recorded run's item is held or owner-blocked (an open ask, or `held` in poll-state.json) and no lead has
pending work, the backstop waits its idle cap, at least 4 h from arming; each scan recomputes this both ways, so work
becoming held extends the wait and a run or lead message that can move restores the short backstop; ask deadlines and
poll wakes are unchanged, and `mdstack poll`'s `hold-released` wakes the coordinator when the owner lifts a hold (#394).
