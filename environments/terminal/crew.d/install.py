"""`mdstack install` puts a stable `mdstack` on the user's PATH for the release bundle it runs from (#1317).

Usage: mdstack install [--name NAME] [--dry-run]

Run it from a bundle extracted into <root>/releases/, root being ~/.mdstack by default or any other root (#1324).
It points that root's releases/current at the bundle and writes the launcher <root>/bin/mdstack, a shell script
that runs releases/current/cli/mdstack, so a later `mdstack upgrade --version` moves the launcher with no PATH
change. When <root>/bin is not on PATH, it links mdstack into the first directory on PATH under your home that it
can write and that holds no other mdstack (for example ~/.local/bin), else prints the one line to add to your
shell profile. It never edits a shell rc file. --name NAME names the launcher and its PATH link NAME instead, so a
second root does not take the first root's `mdstack`; it never replaces another root's command. --dry-run prints
the plan and writes nothing. Doctor reports a missing or stale launcher and a PATH that resolves its name to
something else. Re-running is idempotent.
