"""`mdstack route` consumes mechanical wakes without a coordinator model turn. The watcher calls it before waking
window 0. Worker completion retries admission in all pending pools. A backstop wake also runs `mdstack gc --apply`,
at most 5 removals of merged, landed run copies a missed close-out left (#316); its report goes to gc/backstop.txt.
New heads and escalated rechecks start review;
approved merge-ups stay queued for synthesizer dispatch. A change that resolves express never starts a reviewer pass.
Solo build wakes are consumed; solo builder findings stay queued for coordinator pickup.
Passed reviews start validation, including after zero-step CI startup failures (ci-infra goes to the coordinator). Terminal
reviewers/synthesizers are killed and dequeued; a finished relay = coordinator run (the researcher) is killed and its done: wakes
the coordinator, and that queued done: never kills a later run reusing the window name (#1092); a reflection run's
`done: reflection <window> <url>` puts the report URL on the relayed wake and reaps only the run for that window (#1520); merged PRs are closed out,
and a merge that an open issue's `Depends on` names stays queued so the coordinator dispatches the dependent (#814), as does
one that closes an active milestone's last open item or is a release cut, noted `milestone-complete` (#1559). Progress lines are ignored. Judgement records remain in the queue,
including red CI, changes, stale heads, holds, failed commands, dialogs, blocked runs and owner asks. Red CI for a
superseded head and synthesizer gate-status blocks that only wait (`wait=ci,review,validation,selfgate,train`) are consumed.
A lead's `waiting: #<n> owner|hold|ci id=<id>` line is consumed; the watcher keeps that id off its retries (#1715).
A lead's or gone run's `blocked:` line whose typed items are all closed or merged, or whose pinned head or round is
superseded, is consumed (#1476); an open issue, a current head or an unreadable item keeps it. A dead or missing stale
wake whose run identity an idle reclaim recorded is consumed; a replacement under the same name still wakes (#1552).
Routing is serialized; interrupted batches survive in wake/queue.jsonl.route-* and are retried. Reviewer spawns
are deduplicated by PR/head/pass/round against live and queued runs, section files and pass markers posted by this
runtime's reviewer (its login and signature; #1290); the head-verdict check that gates a reviewer spawn counts only
that reviewer's verdicts too.
Synthesizers remain alive while land requests lack completion or other inbox messages lack acknowledgment, and through
a merged PR's close-out while their own spawn PR lacks completion (its direct-land main CI check, #1339);
the inbox check and reap share the queue lock with send's inbox append.
With the synthesizer lead installed (#1569), `review-approved`, `selfgate-passed`, `ci-passed` with a passing verdict
or self-gate at head, and approved merge-ups become durable `work` events in its land queue, never coordinator
wakes (a merge-up head's `ci-passed` counts its approved previous head, and a head-pinned coordinator `merge-ok`
steer counts as the §7 approval override); a superseded one is dropped, and an
unapproved `ci-passed` is consumed unless held CI refs for that PR
(`ci/<n>-*.json`) still wait on it. Before forwarding, a passing verdict at head from this runtime's reviewer sets
`crew:approved` and drops a superseded `crew:changes`/`crew:in-review`, read back (#1464).
Its waiting gate-status blocks are consumed like a synthesizer's; its other
`blocked:` lines (owner merge-ok, sensitive, holds, `main red`) stay queued for the coordinator; a clean
`train-report` (all landed, `dropped=none stop=none`) is consumed. After its land's close-out, route queues the
away-only Slack `land` message itself and hands `crew:ready` dependents to the builder lead; only dependents that are
not ready still wake the coordinator.
A poll `pr-conflicting` at the live head becomes one builder-lead `merge-up` handoff before any CI (#1398); a moved
head or resolved conflict is consumed, and held, escalated, solo or lead-less conflicts stay queued.
