"""Tests for check-repo.py. Python 3 stdlib only, no network.

Bad secret fixtures are stored defanged (a `~~` marker splits each token) so
the repo never contains a matching string; this runner strips the marker into a
temp dir and expects check-repo.py to fail with `file:3: [<rule>]`, where
<rule> is named on the fixture's `# expect:` line. Structural checks (missing
file/section, broken link) are built in temp dirs so no extra .md fixtures
exist for markdownlint/lychee to see.

Covers: bad fixtures per pattern, a good fixture,
fence/link/section/file-selection cases, denylist hit/miss/unset with a temp
denylist, deliverables match/unclassified/double match/bad row/missing manifest
in temp git repos and the current tree, spec-status valid/empty/unknown/missing
cell/no Status column/fenced/no tables and the current tree, design-headers
open/closed/unknown/allowlisted/stale allowlist and the current tree (#259), fragments
valid/`pr: TBD`/each malformed case with its line and the current tree,
script-docs (#325) each kind with and without its docstring or `Usage:` line,
an unparsable file and the current tree, `--help` printing the `Usage:` line
of every script in the current tree, two branches that each add a script
with its docs merging with no conflict (with a shared-table control that
conflicts), and index files (#325): the generated inventory table stale, fixed
by --fix, hand-edited or unmarked, an unsorted manifest, required-docs config
and docs index, a duplicate or missing docs index row, the manifest's why
column, the current tree, and two branches that each add a script, a doc and
their index rows merging with no conflict (with an appended-at-the-end control
that conflicts), and union merge attributes (#1112): present, missing, commented
out, skipped when the doc is absent, the current tree, and two branches that
each append a scenario line at the same place merging with both lines kept,
and core memory (#1230): clean, personal data, a stray file and the current tree,
and role routines (#1247): the contract's vocabulary, an action and event outside it, and the current tree.
Run in CI.
