"""A29 bidirectional handoff between two full teams (docs/campaign-harness.md#a29, #1441), run by `a28/teams.py
--handoff` while both teams are up and ready. `seed` writes the fake forge's live records before `mdstack up`: team a's
`claimed` post on control item 1, a dependency set (#3, its PR #4, #5 depending on #3), a change in review round 1 (#7,
PR #8), a pending owner ask (#9, crew:needs-md) and a backlog item (#10). `roundtrip` runs the real `mdstack handoff`
commands a → b (drain) and b → a (stop) and checks the record: each state once per handoff id, exactly one ack each,
one writer at every step, the outgoing session and watcher gone before `stopped`, the same sets, stages and heads in
both manifests, the kept run named, the round and the ask untouched, and no other post or write on the forge."""
