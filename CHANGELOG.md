# Changelog

All notable changes to this repo are recorded here, in the style of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Every PR adds an entry
(spec R5: date, PR number, summary) and says whether the box skill copy was mirrored (spec R4). See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Self-improve intake (M11): `docs/self-improve.md` (triggers, candidate card,
  accept/close, lesson path, `repo:` vs `crew:` scope, risks),
  `templates/intake-candidate.md`, the offline `scripts/intake-sweep.py` helper
  with `scripts/test-intake-sweep.py` (CI step), a weekly intake note in the
  stuck-PR sweeper template, coordinator/builder notes in `docs/protocol.md`
  and `docs/roles.md`, lesson `2026-10-29-self-improve-intake.md` and a
  findings entry. (#90, issue #89, 2026-10-29) Box skill copy:
  eng-pr-pipeline and eng-crew-roles (coordinator mirrors after merge).
- Synthesizer merge blockers: an open coordinator hold-until-X (or crew hold
  command) overrides standing doc-only merge-ok, and an open `steer cmd=rereview`
  at the current head blocks squash until a fresh `pass=verdict` lands on a
  different engine; protocol §7 and Gate registry, `templates/synthesizer.md`,
  lesson `2026-10-29-synthesizer-hold-race.md`, findings entry, and a
  `check-repo.py` static guard. (#82, issue #81, 2026-10-29) Box skill copy:
  eng-pr-pipeline (coordinator mirrors after merge).
- Correction hierarchy in `docs/lessons/README.md` (architecture, types, lint, CI,
  prose last; "prose only, because ..." exception; new `encoded` status) and the
  first encoded lesson: `check-repo.py` rule `marker-sha` fails a `crew:v1` marker
  whose `sha=` is not a full 40-char SHA, with tests. (#77, issue #69,
  2026-10-28) Box skill copy: no box skill change.
- Merge-enforcement runbook with target rules, plan blocker, application,
  verification, rollback and fail-open; protocol §7 and onboarding pointers.
  (#67, 2026-10-28) Box skill copy: mirror needed (docs/protocol.md §7 pointer).
- Cycle-time and rounds metrics artifact: `docs/metrics/` (README, `prs.md`,
  `prs.csv`), `scripts/metrics-refresh.py` and its offline test, and a metrics
  refresh note in the stuck-PR sweeper template. (#75, issue #63,
  2026-10-28) Box skill copy: not mirrored here; templates/ note to be mirrored
  by the coordinator.
- Owner-SLA drill plan: `docs/metrics/owner-sla-drill.md` (synthetic hold, expected
  timestamps, checks, results table; coordinator owns the clock). (#71, issue #66,
  2026-10-28) Box skill copy: no mirror needed (no protocol or template change).
- Gardening findings buffer: `docs/findings/README.md` (how to append a smell,
  when to batch, ownership, entry template) and `docs/findings/buffer.md`
  seeded with the recurring builder B2 watch smell (PRs #35, #38, #41); lessons
  README points to it. (#78, issue #68, 2026-10-28) Box skill copy: no box
  skill change.
- Lessons log: `docs/lessons/README.md` (entry format and index) and
  `docs/lessons/2026-10-19-bottlenecks.md`. Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` (iteration
  process) and this changelog. (#15, 2026-10-20) Box skill copy: no box skill
  change.
- Architecture overview and docs index. (#8, 2026-10-20) Box skill copy: no box
  skill change.
- Crew collaboration-flow diagram. (#10, 2026-10-19) Box skill copy: no box skill
  change.
- Crew protocol doc: `docs/protocol.md` ports the eng-pr-pipeline protocol into
  the repo. (#14, 2026-10-20) Box skill copy: no box skill change.
- Roles, tiers and engines: `docs/roles.md` ports the `eng-crew-roles` box skill.
  (#13, 2026-10-20) Box skill copy: not edited (the doc is a port with no new
  policy).
- Routine and listener templates per role (`templates/`) and AgentConnect
  examples. (#16, 2026-10-20) Box skill copy: no mirror needed (new files only).
- Crew-flow diagram embedded in `docs/architecture.md`. (#22, 2026-10-20) Box skill
  copy: no box skill change.
- Onboarding runbook for a new repo: `docs/runbook-new-repo.md`. (#26, 2026-10-20)
  Box skill copy: no box skill change.
- CI repo guard: `scripts/check-repo.py` checks for secrets, required docs and
  sections, and relative links, with fixture tests. (#17, 2026-10-20) Box skill
  copy: no box skill change.
- Protocol: evidence a reviewer's verdict relies on is committed on the PR head,
  never a side branch; evidence-only changes get a rereview steer
  (`docs/protocol.md` §3, §6). New lessons entry
  `docs/lessons/2026-10-20-evidence-on-pr-head.md`. (#23, issue #19, 2026-10-20)
  Box skill copy: Ash (coordinator) updated the box eng-pr-pipeline skill in
  sync with this change.
- Lesson statuses use one vocabulary (`applied` / `superseded` / `open`) and were
  re-verified against `main`; new drift check `scripts/check-skill-drift.py`
  (with `scripts/test-check-skill-drift.py`) compares `docs/protocol.md` and
  `docs/roles.md` to the box skills, run by the coordinator on
  `crew:needs-mirror` and after protocol/template PRs. (#74, issue #70,
  2026-10-28) Box skill copy: not mirrored here; mirror by the coordinator if
  protocol/templates changed (this change touches neither).

### Changed

- Builder heartbeat and stuck-PR sweeper watchdog: builder workers refresh a
  `heartbeat:` line in their claim file every 5 min; the sweeper's `builder-silent`
  row flags a claim silent for 15 min and messages the builder. Bottleneck lesson
  #2 marked documented. (#72, issue #65, 2026-10-28) Box skill copy: not mirrored
  here; mirror by the coordinator.
- Templates match the lighter lane's B2/watch and mirror exemptions; reviewer
  verdict-pass messages route REQUEST_CHANGES, and sweeper/coordinator messages
  route red CI and close-out to the builder. Lane membership uses the full
  diff at head; fixes leaving the lane attach B2. Follows up the lighter-lane
  notes (Refs #55). (issue #57, 2026-10-25)
  Box skill copy: not mirrored here; mirror by the coordinator.

- The coordinator owns triage: a window at least once per awake half-day, and
  every open issue leaves it `crew:ready`, `crew:spec`, `crew:needs-md`,
  deferred to the next milestone, or closed with a reason. The stuck-PR sweeper
  promotes `crew:hold` / `crew:escalated` items waiting on the user for more
  than 2h (awake, PT) to `crew:needs-md`, routes nudge-cap escalations through
  the coordinator, skips held and needs-md PRs for stall nudges but lists them,
  and reports open issues with no `crew:*` state label older than one awake
  day. A reviewer-validator that holds its verdict for a user decision adds
  `crew:needs-md` and posts a `pass=hold` COMMENT review with `verdict=n/a`
  naming the open item (folds in #48). (#56, issue #51, 2026-10-25)
  Box skill copy: not mirrored here; mirror by the coordinator.

- Protocol and templates change in milestone batches, with a blocking-gate
  exception governed by a gate contract and registry. The lighter lane for
  non-protocol docs skips B2 and the mirror hold, keeps CI and review/validation,
  and routes fixes to the builder by message. (#55, issue #50, 2026-10-25)
  Box skill copy: not mirrored here; mirror by the coordinator.

- Owner decisions have a 2h awake-hours PT SLA, `crew:needs-md` escalation,
  timed defaults, and asks only through the coordinator. Standing doc-only
  merge-ok (excluding code, `.github/`, `templates/`, and `docs/protocol.md`)
  preserves all other merge gates. Onboarding requires Milestones and a
  Project board; closed milestones are frozen. (#54, issue #49, 2026-10-25)
  Box skill copy: not mirrored here; mirror by the coordinator.

- Merge gate requires the builder's `pass=watch` marker (full 40-char `sha=` of
  any commit on the PR, same rule as the reviewer cross-check) in protocol §7
  and the synthesizer template; a PR without it is held and the synthesizer
  pings the builder with priority. The reviewer's first verdict pings the
  builder with priority (still never creating B2). New lessons entry
  `docs/lessons/2026-10-23-merge-gate-watch-race.md` for the PR #41 hand-off
  race. A PR changing `docs/protocol.md` or `templates/` gets a
  `crew:needs-mirror` label from the reviewer's verdict pass; the merge gate
  refuses to merge while it is present, and the coordinator removes it on
  posting the box-skill mirror comment, then pings the synthesizer (new label in
  the runbook, architecture, wiring and role templates). The gate's external and
  cutover exemptions are now explicit with reasons, plus a third for
  coordinator-opened `crew:spec` PRs (no builder, no B2; merge on `/crew
  merge-ok`). A cutover PR is gated again as soon as its builder posts its watch
  review or any `crew:v1` marker after the cutover (by post time, covering B2
  attached at the unchanged cutover SHA), independent of the marker. The
  reviewer adds `crew:needs-mirror` before posting the verdict, but skips it
  when the coordinator's mirror comment is newer than the last
  protocol/template-touching commit (a later such commit needs a fresh mirror
  comment); the synthesizer uses the same freshness rule, and the synthesizer derives the
  hold from the changed paths, not only the label. (#45, issue #43, 2026-10-23) Box
  skill copy: not mirrored here; mirroring the box eng-pr-pipeline skill is for
  Ash.
- Reviewer watch cross-check accepts a `pass=watch` marker whose full 40-char
  `sha=` is any commit on the PR, not only the head (the marker is posted once
  per PR, so a CI-fix push before the first verdict must not look like a missing
  watch); `<sha7>` wording in the protocol now includes review headers; the
  "Stale known-gap bullet" lessons entry gains its status and linked-issue
  fields. (#44, issue #42, 2026-10-23) Box skill copy: mirror of the box
  `eng-pr-pipeline` skill is for the coordinator (Ash).
- Watch hand-off: the routine folder id is the single identifier written to
  `watches/pr-<n>.b2`; the B1 run only requests the hand-off and the parent turn
  alone verifies, writes the marker file and posts `pass=watch`; every marker's
  `sha=` is the full 40-char head SHA and the reviewer cross-check matches on it.
  Stale #19 known-gap bullet updated. New lessons entry
  `docs/lessons/2026-10-23-watch-handoff-first-run.md`. (#41, issue #39,
  2026-10-23) Box skill copy: mirror of the box `eng-pr-pipeline` skill is for
  the coordinator (Ash).
- `docs/protocol.md` links `docs/roles.md` (and its worktree isolation section)
  directly instead of calling it planned; removed the resolved #29 entry from the
  runbook's known gaps. `docs/README.md` moves `scripts/` to Available now, and
  the Planned section now says nothing is planned. (#40, issue #29, 2026-10-23)
  Box skill copy: no box skill change.
- Aligned the live `crew:needs-md` label description on eng-crew with the runbook
  ("Blocked on an owner decision (recommended default + deadline)") and removed
  the resolved #28 entry from the runbook's known gaps. (#38, issue #28, 2026-10-23)
  Box skill copy: no box skill change.
- Engine-steer example uses the actual-builder-engine wording and links
  `docs/roles.md#actual-builder-engine`. (#35, issue #34, 2026-10-23) Box skill
  copy: no box skill change.
- Merge-ups use no review round: a clean merge-up after an APPROVE gets a formal
  merge-up re-approve with the same round; after CHANGES it gets an ack with no
  round and no verdict; a conflict resolution that changes behavior is a normal
  round. The #16 ack-based merge-gate exception is removed from the reviewer,
  synthesizer and sweeper templates. (#32, 2026-10-21) Box skill copy: the box
  eng-pr-pipeline skill already has this rule; the repo mirrors it.
- Actual builder engine: a round's builder engine is the engine that actually
  wrote its commits, named in the fix note, an `Engine:` commit trailer and the
  builder marker; the reviewer must differ from it. If the builder marker and the
  fix note or commit trailer disagree on the engine, the note or trailer wins,
  and before merge the reviewer re-checks at head (fresh review + validation) on
  an engine different from the actual builder engine, triggered by the
  coordinator's rereview steer. (#33, 2026-10-21) Box skill copy:
  the box eng-pr-pipeline skill already reads the engine that actually wrote the
  round; the eng-crew-roles box skill still needs the mirror (flagged to the
  coordinator).
- Builder per-PR watch B2 attachment is verified and observable: builder parent
  turn lists routines, confirms the four events, records `watches/pr-<n>.b2`
  and posts a `pass=watch` marker; sweeper `no-builder-watch` row and
  detection-window note; reviewer first-verdict cross-check; protocol event
  list and runbook B2 creation point corrected. New lessons entry
  `docs/lessons/2026-10-23-builder-watch-attach.md`. (#37, issue #36,
  2026-10-23) Box skill copy: the box `eng-pr-pipeline` skill mirror (the `watch`
  pass value in §4, B2 events `ci-failed`, `review-changes-requested`,
  `pr-merged`, `pr-closed` in the §6 builder line, and the attach-verification
  step) is applied by the coordinator before merge per R4. AC1 dry run on PR #37
  recorded in the lessons entry.

### Fixed

- Crew-flow diagram: builder engine order and escalation arrow. (#12, 2026-10-20) Box
  skill copy: no box skill change.
- A failed validation pass never becomes an APPROVE: protocol (stage 7 and merge
  gate) and templates now say so; AC4 consumers and a stale live claim corrected.
  (#25, 2026-10-20) Box skill copy: the gate rule and the AC4 exception are both in
  the box skill; the repo mirrors them.

## Bootstrap (2026-10-19)

### Added

- Framework spec (`docs/specs/framework.md`), README and CI (markdownlint and an
  offline link check). Direct commit to main (no PR). Box skill copy: no box skill change.
