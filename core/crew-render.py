"""Renderer for mdstack: resolved profile + inputs to role briefs and runtime artifacts. Python 3.11+ stdlib only.

Usage: crew-render.py --project FILE [--org-profile FILE] [--inputs DIR] [--diff-paths FILE] --out DIR
Inputs (default: the repo's templates/): core/<role>.md for each role, if core/ exists -> briefs/<role>.md;
runtimes/<runtime>/** of the profile's runtime -> runtime/** (runtime.options.role_runtime swaps one role's
template for runtimes/<other>/<role>.md, #1055); backends/<backend>.toml maps each
<op:concern.operation> to a command, and its [placeholders] kept list declares extra run-time placeholders.
Pack overlay: a render/ directory in the org profile's directory (else paths.pack) is searched per file
before the inputs. runtime.options.notes.render files are appended verbatim to that role's rendered brief.
Core memory (docs/memory.md): each role's rendered brief (a lead's carries its pool role's; on a runtime whose
briefs are per-routine files, the role's discovery file) gets the owner profile and the role's memory file from
memory/ in the checkout (paths.checkout, else the profile's directory), before any render note; inside the
closing fence when the brief ends in one (a fenced routine prompt). A memory lint problem fails closed. The
size-budget render (normalize_paths) leaves memory out: its files have their own limits.
Budget headroom (#1056): after a successful render, stderr gets one line per role brief with its path-normalized
bytes against [size_budget] (the bootstrap measure) and its delivered bytes (core memory and render notes
included), and a WARNING inside BUDGET_BAND of the budget or over it. Output paths and exit codes are unchanged.
Fails closed: every problem (an unknown placeholder, a missing mapping, an unsupported capability) prints as
`file:line: reason`; exit 1 and write nothing if any, else 0.
Placeholder map: scripts/README.md (Renderer).
Enabled builder.precheck appends ordered steps and profile commands to builder briefs.
Flavor placeholders use the project preset/custom knobs; --diff-paths supplies newline-separated
repo-relative paths (both rename paths) for class rigor. Without paths, classes wait for live resolution.
Unset flavor resolves standard and renders its baseline line like an explicit name.
This render baseline supplies no item record or merge authority; explicit precheck settings stay in force.
Grok Bot SKILL.md inputs include the reviewed docs with <include:docs/protocol.md>
or <include:docs/roles.md>. Included docs keep their illustrative placeholders;
relative Markdown links point into the installed bundle, not the skill directory.
Builder and solo session briefs include the PR conventions section from docs/roles.md;
its illustrative placeholders stay literal and its link labels render as plain text.
A template line starting <strategy:merge> or <strategy:rebase> renders, without that prefix, only when the change
backend's resolved strategy.update_from_base (default merge) matches.
A line exactly <control-item:set> or <control-item:none> opens a block, closed by a line exactly <control-item:end>,
that renders, without its marker lines, only when repo.control_item is set (any tracker item) or unset.
A line exactly <session-backend:hosted> or <session-backend:local> opens a block, closed by a line exactly
<session-backend:end>, that renders, without its marker lines, only when runtime.options.session_backend is or is
not "hosted"; it may sit inside a control-item block (#1052).
<op:a.b|c.d> renders the first listed operation the backend supports. A researchers cap of 0 renders no
researcher template, so it needs none of the researcher's operations.
A line exactly <include:policy/DIR/NAME.md> is replaced by templates/policy/DIR/NAME.md (pack overlay first), so
a role's shared policy is authored once; its lines then render like the including file's. Bounded: one level, so
an include line inside a fragment fails closed, as does a missing fragment.
