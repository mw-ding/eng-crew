Verdict portability: apply protocol §7's full content, CI, live-gate and
merge-marker rules.

Gate-status reporting (diagnostic only; changes no gate or exemption):

- On every wake and sweep, for each open PR at the live head, collect ALL unmet
  applicable §7 items, including blocking holds, before returning blocked.
  Stop without posting for a closed/merged PR or a stale event SHA.
- Maintain one COMMENT review per PR, headed
  "[<SynthesizerBot>/gate-status] @ <sha7>", with the full current head marker
  <!-- crew:v1 role=synthesizer pass=gate-status pr=<n> sha=<head-sha> round=n/a verdict=n/a status=blocked -->
  List only unmet items below, with the concrete missing condition and who owes
  it. Split evidence presence from validation; list both if both are missing.
  Apply the existing gate's overrides and runtime exemptions before listing.

| Missing item | Who owes it |
|---|---|
| Approval at head / later changes request | <ReviewerBot>: review or fix verdict; <BuilderBot>: requested fixes |
| Validation at head | <ReviewerBot> (validator): validation verdict |
| Owner merge-ok | Owner, via <CoordinatorBot>: per-PR permission unless an existing grant applies |
| Blocking hold / escalation | <CoordinatorBot>: clear hold or route owner decision / dependency |
| Open rereview / engine disagreement | <CoordinatorBot>: request re-check; <ReviewerBot>: fresh verdict |
| Builder pre-review check | <BuilderBot>: fresh passing marker or reasoned N/A at head; owner via <CoordinatorBot>: per-change override |
| Required inline evidence | <BuilderBot>: inline proof validated at head or reasoned N/A |
| Runtime builder watch | <BuilderBot>: attach watch and post valid marker, only where required |
| Runtime mirror hold | <CoordinatorBot>: mirror, clean drift check and clear label, only where required |
| Tested with default branch | <SynthesizerBot>: <tested-update>; <BuilderBot>: conflicts |
| CI green / draft / mergeable / base | <BuilderBot>: failing checks or PR state; CI provider: pending checks |
| Linked tracker item | <BuilderBot>: link the issue unless exempt |

- Find the existing review by your identity and pass=gate-status marker across
  ALL heads, not by sha alone. Create with <op:review.post-narrative> only if absent;
  otherwise edit that review body in place with <op:markers.edit-status>.
  A gate-status marker never supplies approval, permission, a verdict or a round,
  and never triggers the section 6 pass-marker idempotency stop.
- When blocked, wake <CoordinatorBot> with the PR, head, review link and missing
  items (append blocked: #<n> <head-sha> gate-status REVIEW_URL to
  $CREW_STATUS +wait=CSV if only ci/review/validation/selfgate/train pend). Do not re-run evidence, tests, review or validation: inspect
  presence and verdict only. Repeated unchanged wakes reuse the same review.
- If no items remain, edit an existing gate-status review to "No unmet gate
  items at this head", status=clear and the current sha; do not create an empty
  review. Re-check §7 before landing; status=clear is not a merge signal.

<strategy:rebase>Rebase backend (`strategy.update_from_base = "rebase"`): `mdstack train build` and
<strategy:rebase>`bisect` refuse, so every train rule below is void. Land each ready PR alone, in
<strategy:rebase>turn: `<op:change.update-from-base>`, required CI green at the new head, verdict
<strategy:rebase>portability, then the head-pinned land; a conflict or differing patch goes to
<strategy:rebase><BuilderBot>.
<strategy:rebase>
Land rule (protocol §7, land rules and merge trains):
a PR is ready when it passes steps 1 and 2 at its head, apart from being
behind the default branch. Before step 3, look at every open crew PR:
Recorded urgency takes precedence over batching below; an open stop still blocks.<land-rule>

- With `lone_pr_land = "direct"`, exactly one ready PR lands immediately
  through step 3, even behind the default branch: no update-branch, no
  one-member train and no wait for another approval. Re-survey under the land
  lock immediately before the squash; if two or more are ready, train them.
  Only the tested-with-default-branch gate is waived. Every other §7 gate
  still applies at head: passing verdict/review/validate markers, CI green,
  no open rereview or hold, sensitive merge-ok, mirror and `MERGEABLE`.
  Record `Tested-with-default-branch waiver: lone_pr_land=direct, exactly one ready PR`
  and `Land rule: alone, direct` in the merge post, then perform step 4.
  A train whose drops left one member (`path=direct`, `collapsed-to-direct`)
  lands this way; its merge post also copies the record's `path_reason`.
- With `lone_pr_land = "direct"`, two or more ready PRs use a merge train,
  regardless of `train_min`. With `lone_pr_land = "train"`, use the rules below.
- An urgent ready PR (a release blocker, a security fix or an owner
  request), or one ready and none close (no other PR in review or re-check
  that should pass within `train_window` seconds): land it alone, through step 3
  if its head contains the default branch; else run
  `<op:change.update-from-base>`, wait for CI, prove verdict portability
  and re-check the live gate. Never send it back solely for being behind.
- At least `train_min` ready at once (default 2): a merge train (below).
  Below that threshold, land ready PRs alone when none is close.
- Fewer than `train_min` ready and another PR close: wait for it,
  re-checking each minute (or sooner at the deadline), at most
  `train_window` seconds after the first became ready, then train two or more ready PRs, or land the only one alone.
  A single ready PR with none close merges alone immediately.

Each `[<SynthesizerBot>/merge]` post names the rule in one `Land rule:` line,
for example `Land rule: alone, none close`.
