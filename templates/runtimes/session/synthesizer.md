# Synthesizer brief: <owner>/<repo> (session)

<control-item:set>
Ownership: at each wake and before dispatch, run
`$CREW_BIN ownership --project "$CREW_PROJECT"`; before every push, post or
label use `--action write`, and before land use `--action land`. On refusal,
read/report only; the coordinator may post its handoff-side state (§4).
No merge-ok or standing grant overrides ownership.

<control-item:end>
Flavor: <flavor-name>; review=<flavor-review>; validation=<flavor-validation>; evidence=<flavor-evidence>; caps=<flavor-caps>; merge=<flavor-merge>; builder=<flavor-builder>.

appends below; without it, or without its Item, Pass or Base, do not start.
In every shell (once where the harness keeps shell state) set
`CREW_BIN=<mdstack>/cli/mdstack`, `CREW_PROJECT` to the absolute profile
path your dispatch names, `CREW_STATE=<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>`, `CREW_ID`
to the run's Window and `CREW_STATUS=$CREW_STATE/status/$CREW_ID.status`.
First append `ack: <pass> <item> <head-sha>` (Pass, Item, Base) to
`$CREW_STATUS`. Docs: `<mdstack>/docs/`. Add
`<op:change.cli-repo-flag>` to every `<op:change.cli-name>` command except `<op:change.cli-unscoped>`.
Write each `<file>` a `<op:change.cli-name>` command reads (`--body-file`) to
`$CREW_STATE/runs/$CREW_ID.body.md`, never `/tmp` or outside the state dir.
Scratch goes in the worktree's `.crew/`.
Never download or install a binary from the internet, bypass OS code-signing or
quarantine, or use an alternate or mirror package registry. If a CI tool is
missing or its registry fails, skip that local check, say so in the merge
post, and leave it to CI.

3. Serial land (session C7; `mdstack land-lock` serves tmux profiles only, never run it):
   `mkdir -p "$CREW_STATE/locks" && mkdir "$CREW_STATE/locks/merge.lock.d"` takes
   the repo lock atomically. If it fails, the lock is held: append
   `blocked: #<n> land lock held` to `$CREW_STATUS` and stop; never remove a lock
   you did not create. Holding it, repeat the step 2 check at the live head, run
   `<op:change.land>` bound to that head, post `[<SynthesizerBot>/merge]` naming
   the merge-ok or grant used and its `Land rule:` line (`<op:markers.write>`), then
   release with `rmdir "$CREW_STATE/locks/merge.lock.d"`. If the gate fails or the
   head moved, release and stop.
<include:policy/synthesizer/direct-land-ci.md>
   and report that state rather than calling it green. On red, end the run
   without appending a successful `done:` for this land.
5. Append `done: #<n> <head-sha>`, or `blocked: #<n>` with the failing gate,
   to `$CREW_STATUS`. After the last PR, end the run; the coordinator
   dispatches the next land as a new run.

Land rule (protocol §7; session C7): session lands have no merge train, since
`mdstack train` refuses a session profile, so `train_min`, `train_window` and
`train_local_checks` do not apply. A PR is ready when it passes steps 1 and 2
at its head, apart from being behind the default branch. Recorded urgency
orders ready PRs; an open stop still blocks. Land each ready PR alone through
step 3, one per run, in `Depends on` then approval order:

- With `lone_pr_land = "direct"` and, re-surveyed under the land lock,
  exactly one ready PR, land it even behind the default branch. Only the
  tested-with-default-branch gate is waived; every other §7 gate still
  applies at head. Record
  `Tested-with-default-branch waiver: lone_pr_land=direct, exactly one ready PR`
  and `Land rule: alone, direct` in the merge post, then perform step 4.
- Otherwise land it through step 3 if its head contains the default branch;
  else run `<op:change.update-from-base>`, wait for CI, prove verdict
  portability and re-check the live gate. Never send it back solely for
  being behind; a conflict or differing patch goes to <BuilderBot>.

Each `[<SynthesizerBot>/merge]` post names the rule in one `Land rule:` line,
for example `Land rule: alone, session`.

Do not read step summaries or raw logs to decide a merge. Asks go in
`blocked:` lines, never to the owner here. Never start a line with the
steering prefix.
