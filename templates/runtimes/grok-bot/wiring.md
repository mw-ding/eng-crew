# `<owner>/<repo>` wiring: event-driven PR pipeline (template)

Copy to `<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/wiring.md` and fill in. Keep it as the one
place that lists what is installed for this repo. Protocol: the
`eng-pr-pipeline` skill. Roles and engines: the `eng-crew-roles` skill. Terms:
[../../../docs/architecture.md](../../../docs/architecture.md).

Repo: `<owner>/<repo>`, default branch `<default-branch>`. Drafted `<date>`.
Status of each item below: `<planned | applied | live>` with a date.

## 0. Facts found in the repo

Record before installing anything. Examples of what to check:

- Which identities author and review PRs; is `<reviewer-login>` a write
  collaborator so that its reviews are binding?
- Is the repo a fork? Do upstream syncs have to go through a PR?
- Does a scratch or E2E flow open PRs or issues here? If so, name how bots
  ignore them.
- CI: which workflows and aggregate check names run on `pull_request`, which
  on push to `<default-branch>`, and which events re-run them (for example PR
  title or body edits, or `ready_for_review`).
- Do conflicting PRs get no CI? Does a draft turned ready get no CI?
- Does the product use its own labels or comment commands here? Crew state
  uses only `crew:*` and never touches them.

## 1. Identities and shared state

| Bot | Role | `gh` identity |
|---|---|---|
| `<CoordinatorBot>` | Coordinator | `GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token --user <author-login>)`; `<reviewer-login>` for steering signals |
| `<BuilderBot>` | Builder | `<author-login>` |
| `<ReviewerBot>` | Reviewer-validator | `<reviewer-login>` for all reviews |
| `<SynthesizerBot>` | Synthesizer | `<author-login>` |

Shared state: `<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/` with `claims/` (per-pass claim
files), `locks/merge.lock` (serial-merge flock), `reviewer-engines.md` and
`sweeper-state.json`.

Labels to create: `crew:ready`, `crew:in-review`, `crew:changes`,
`crew:approved`, `crew:escalated`, `crew:hold`, `crew:external`, `crew:spec`,
`crew:needs-md`, `crew:needs-mirror`.

## 2. Routines per bot

Every saved prompt is an intent and defers to the skills. Each starts with the
same guard: re-read live PR or issue state, and stop on `crew:hold`,
`crew:escalated`, a stale SHA, or an existing marker for this pass at head.
Bots never post PR conversation comments or inline comments.

| Routine | Bot | Trigger | Template |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 build intake | `<BuilderBot>` | `issue-assigned`, allowlist `<user-logins>` | [builder-b1.md](builder-b1.md) |
| B2 per-PR watch (outside lighter lane) | `<BuilderBot>` | PR-scoped: `ci-failed`, `review-changes-requested`, `pr-merged`, `pr-closed` | [builder-b2.md](builder-b2.md) |
| V1 PR intake | `<ReviewerBot>` | `pr-opened`, no allowlist | [reviewer-validator.md](reviewer-validator.md) |
| V2 per-PR watch | `<ReviewerBot>` | PR-scoped: `ci-passed`, `review-requested`, `pr-merged`, `pr-closed` | [reviewer-v2-watch.md](reviewer-v2-watch.md) |
| S1 merge on approval | `<SynthesizerBot>` | `review-approved`, no allowlist | [synthesizer.md](synthesizer.md) |
| A1 after merge | `<CoordinatorBot>` | `pr-merged`; `ci-failed` on `<default-branch>` | [coordinator-after-merge.md](coordinator-after-merge.md) |
| A2 steering dispatcher | `<CoordinatorBot>` | `pr-comment`, `inline-review-comment`, allowlist `<user-logins>` | [coordinator-steering-dispatcher.md](coordinator-steering-dispatcher.md) |
| A3 stuck-PR sweeper | `<CoordinatorBot>` | schedule | [coordinator-stuck-pr-sweeper.md](coordinator-stuck-pr-sweeper.md) |

Deliberately not subscribed: `review-commented` (where all bot narrative
lands), `pr-pushed`, `review-thread-*`. Only the dispatcher holds comment
events. A researcher role, if any, has no listeners.

Lighter-lane PRs touch only docs, with no code, no `.github/`, no `templates/`
and no `docs/protocol.md`, judged from the full diff at head. They install no
B2, post no `pass=watch` and never get `crew:needs-mirror`. On a verdict-pass
`REQUEST_CHANGES`, `<ReviewerBot>`'s parent turn messages `<BuilderBot>` with
PR, head SHA and findings link; A3's changes-requested row backs it up. A3's
"CI failed at head, no ci-fix" row or a direct `<CoordinatorBot>` message
routes red CI: no lighter-lane `ci-failed` listener fires. `<CoordinatorBot>`
messages the builder for merge/close cleanup. If a fix leaves the lane, the
builder attaches B2 using the verified hand-off in [B1](builder-b1.md).

Solo items use crew:solo and install no B2. Findings, red CI and conflicts
route through <CoordinatorBot> to the PR for the owner's session to pick up;
review and synthesizer listeners stay. Every other gate still applies.

### 2a. Steering wiring

Single dispatcher: `<CoordinatorBot>`. The allowlist gates the **PR author**, so
A2 fires for every comment on PRs authored by `<user-logins>`; the prompt checks
the **commenter**. Commands (spelled after the steering prefix):

| Subcommand | Owner | Dispatch signal | Owner wakes via |
|---|---|---|---|
| hold | Coordinator | add `crew:hold` | none |
| resume | Coordinator | remove hold and escalated, `resume` marker, re-emit the stage signal | reviewer, builder or synthesizer |
| rework: `<note>` | Builder | `<reviewer-login>` REQUEST_CHANGES, `steer cmd=rework` | B2 `review-changes-requested`; coordinator message in lighter lane |
| rereview | Reviewer | re-request `<reviewer-login>` | V2 `review-requested` |
| merge-ok | Synthesizer | `<reviewer-login>` APPROVE, `steer cmd=merge-ok sha=<head-sha>` | S1 `review-approved` |
| escalate | Coordinator | `crew:escalated` plus an escalation COMMENT review | none |

External PRs: A2 does not fire, because the author is not allowlisted. Add a
per-PR watch with the comment events plus `pr-merged` and `pr-closed` when one
needs steering. Issue comments wake no one; steer issues by assignment, labels
or chat.

### 2b. Owner-feedback intake (coordinator chat)

On owner feedback, follow
[the recipe](../../../docs/self-improve.md#owner-feedback-recipe): verify
the owner, link the affected issue or PR, and file an intake
card with Trigger `owner-feedback` and Failure class `too-slow`, `too-costly`
or `missed-bug`. Clarify a missing source or unclear class before filing;
search open and closed cards by Source and Failure class to avoid duplicates.
Scope defaults to `repo:`; Decision stays `pending` until normal triage.
Never quote private chat or change a flavor from a card. This is a coordinator
parent-turn duty;
it adds no listener or steering command.

### 2c. Milestone admission (coordinator)

<include:policy/coordinator/milestone-admission.md>

<include:policy/coordinator/plan-gate.md>

<include:policy/coordinator/spec-bookends.md>

The coordinator applies this rule before assigning new build issues to B1.

### 2d. Express fallback and triage (coordinator)

Express stays an option on Grok Bot, not enabled: no self-gate runs here.
Before assigning an item with an express record or `crew:express` to B1, and
when a role routes one back, post a signed pass=flavor record naming the
item's normal flavor (Reason: Grok crew-lane fallback), then remove
`crew:express`. The item then runs the crew lane with independent review.
`triage.enabled = true` installs no Grok timer; triage stays the
coordinator's dispositions. The researcher is never the triage host.

### 2e. Researcher handoff (coordinator parent turn)

For an owner deep dive (more than a few lookups), file or link the source
issue, then:

1. Post one signed `<CoordinatorBot>` request comment on the source issue:
   question, scope, deliverable.
2. Start one fresh read-only worker from [researcher.md](researcher.md) plus
   `<mdstack>/cli/mdstack brief --item "issue #<n>" --pass research
   --base "$(git rev-parse origin/<default-branch>)" --engine "<engine> <model> <effort>"`,
   naming the engine it will actually run. It signs with that engine.
3. The worker posts one signed `[<ResearcherBot>/research] #<n>` finding and
   returns its URL.
4. Verify the URL: a comment on issue `#<n>` with
   `role=researcher pass=research issue=<n>` and a signature. Then relay its
   TL;DR to the owner. On a failed check, relay nothing; report it.

No listener, routine, research gate or tmux command is involved, and a
`pass=research` marker is never a verdict or gate input.

## 3. How state passes

`issue-assigned` -> builder builds -> PR opened -> `pr-opened` -> reviewer acks
and watches -> CI -> `ci-passed` -> review and validation -> one formal review
per head SHA (a clean merge-up after changes gets a merge-up ack instead; see
[the protocol](../../../docs/protocol.md#6-duties-on-wake-all-roles)), then either:

- `review-changes-requested` -> B2 (or reviewer parent-turn message in the
  lighter lane) -> builder fixes -> push -> CI -> `ci-passed` -> next round; or
- `review-approved` -> synthesizer gate and merge -> `pr-merged` -> builder
  cleans up (by coordinator message in the lighter lane), coordinator assigns
  the next issue. After each merge the synthesizer update-branches PRs that are
  behind but mergeable; PRs with real
  conflicts go to the builder, who merges `<default-branch>` in with a merge
  commit.

## 4. Enforcement steps (the user decides; all reversible)

Record each as done or not, with a date:

1. `<reviewer-login>` is a write collaborator.
2. `<default-branch>` protection: required checks, 1 approving review,
   administrators included, no force pushes or deletions.
3. Squash-only merges and delete-branch-on-merge.
4. "Only the synthesizer merges" stays convention while bots share an account.
   Real enforcement needs a separate identity for the synthesizer.

## 5. Cutover plan for open PRs

For PRs that exist before the listeners (no `pr-opened` ever fires for them):
install routines, then backfill per-PR watches in one pass (skip B2 for
lighter-lane PRs), post a `cutover` marker on each PR (resets round counting;
it stands in for a missing issue link), label them `crew:changes` or `crew:hold` as appropriate, and kick them
in dependency order. Do not edit PR bodies, since that re-runs some workflows.

## 6. Wake cost

Each wake is a full bot turn. Track estimates per path (clean, typical, worst
before escalation) and the extra cost of steering, so listener changes can be
weighed.

## 7. Open risks

Record unverified listener semantics, PR-body-edit reruns, bot-comment
discipline, steering trust, the draft-to-ready CI gap, silent conflict stalls,
shared identities, external PRs, product collisions and project scope.

## 8. Pilot findings

Dated entries. Examples of what belongs here:

- A routine run cannot create or delete routines; per-PR watches are handed to
  the parent turn, which skips B2 for lighter-lane PRs and otherwise verifies
  B2 after creating it (marker file
  `watches/pr-<n>.b2`, `pass=watch` marker). PR-scoped watches self-delete on
  terminal events.
- A bot COMMENT review fires `pr-comment`; the dispatcher no-ops it.
- Builder and fix workers must set the repo toolchain on `PATH` before pushing.
- Label hygiene: the reviewer removes `crew:in-review` when adding
  `crew:approved` or `crew:changes`.
- Issue-link rule: if the repo forbids closing keywords, `Refs #<n>` satisfies
  the merge gate and the coordinator closes the issue after merge.

## Ownership guard in parent turns

Control item: `<control-item>`; runtime: `<runtime-id>`.
Every role parent turn reads the control-item ownership record at wake start
and before dispatch, push, post, label or land (protocol §4 and §6). A
non-owner reads/reports only; draining starts nothing and lands nothing.
This also applies when creating standing routines or per-PR watches.

On first configured start, the coordinator reads the record and posts
`claimed` only if none exists, then re-reads before dispatch (protocol §4).

## Handoff stop and return

The Grok Bot steps of the [handoff design](../../../docs/handoff.md); the
coordinator's parent turn runs them, since a routine run cannot create or
delete routines.

Outgoing, once the record shows `acked` (in a takeover: read-only from
`takeover`, these steps after `acked`):

- [ ] Every routine's guard no-ops from its next wake; the sweeper reports
      the lost ownership to the coordinator once per handoff id.
- [ ] Remove each per-PR watch (B2, V2), then each standing routine, as in
      offboarding step 2; mark each one removed in section 2.
- [ ] Post `stopped` on the control item (protocol §4). If routines stay as
      no-op guards for a short switch, say so in that post.

Incoming (the return), before the `acked` post:

- [ ] Deploy the render for the live profile and run
      `check-skill-drift.py --project` until it exits 0 (mirror hold gate).
- [ ] Re-create the standing routines from section 2 and mark them active.
- [ ] Backfill B2 and V2 for every open crew PR outside the lighter lane,
      each with the builder's `pass=watch` marker, as in section 5 but with no
      `cutover` marker, so rounds keep counting.
- [ ] Reconcile and ack per the handoff design's resume steps, then lift only
      the manifest's `holds_added` once the outgoing side posted `stopped`.
