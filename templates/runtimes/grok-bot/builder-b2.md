# Builder routine B2: per-PR watch

Owner: `<BuilderBot>`. One watch per PR. `ci-failed` and
`review-changes-requested` belong to B2. `pr-merged` and `pr-closed` are
terminal events shared with V2 ([README.md](../../README.md)). B1 is in
[builder-b1.md](builder-b1.md).

Created by `<BuilderBot>` right after its worker opens PR `<n>`, except for
[lighter-lane PRs](../../../docs/protocol.md#6-duties-on-wake-all-roles): only docs,
no code, no `.github/`, no `templates/` and no `docs/protocol.md`. They install
no B2 and post no `pass=watch`. Their fixes and cleanup arrive by message as
specified in [B1](builder-b1.md), using the same fix/CI-fix behavior below.
Judge membership from the full diff at head after each fix; if it leaves the
lane, the builder's parent turn attaches and verifies B2 and posts `pass=watch`
using B1's hand-off.

## Trigger

```json
{
  "type": "github",
  "repo": "<owner>/<repo>",
  "pr": "<n>",
  "events": ["ci-failed", "review-changes-requested", "pr-merged", "pr-closed"]
}
```

`"<n>"` becomes the PR number as a JSON number when the watch is created.

## Prompt

```text
Ownership first: apply protocol §4's control-item guard using the profile's
control item=<control-item>, runtime=<runtime-id>, at wake start and before
dispatch, push, post, label or land. Non-owning, in transit or unreadable:
read/report only. Draining: in-flight writes only, no new pass or land.

<include:policy/shared/flavor.md>

<include:policy/builder/signing.md>

Builder watch for <owner>/<repo> PR #<n>. Guard first: re-read live state. Stop
on crew:hold or crew:escalated, a stale SHA, or an existing marker for this
pass at head. For crew:solo, skip fixes and route findings/CI refs to the
coordinator for PR pickup by the owner's session; no B2 is required.
Take the claim file
<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/claims/builder-pr<n>-<sha7> atomically before
working (docs/protocol.md §6 step 2); the worker only refreshes its
"heartbeat: <UTC timestamp>" line at least every 5 min and after each commit,
push or post (docs/protocol.md §6).
The worker brief names the absolute claim path and grants write access to it.
The brief also requires reading the repo's root AGENTS.md, if present, before
fixing.

Run block: before each fix or CI-fix worker turn, re-read the live head and
run <eng-crew>/cli/mdstack brief --item "PR #<n>" --pass fix --base
<full-40-char-head-sha> --round <k> --claim
<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/claims/builder-pr<n>-<sha7> --engine
"<engine> <model> <effort>" --worktree <worktree> --comments <comment id>,
where Base is the live PR head and Comments the findings or failed run.
Append its "## This run" block verbatim to the worker prompt; never
hand-write run parameters. Exit 2 means do not dispatch.

ci-failed: ignore cancelled or superseded runs and runs for an older head. Fix
real failures on the branch with a worker, then post a "[<BuilderBot>/ci-fix]"
COMMENT review naming the engine, model and effort that actually wrote the
round (every engine that wrote commits in the round, e.g. both if the worker fell back mid-round), with every commit carrying
an "Engine: <engine> <model> <effort>" trailer and the note's crew:v1 marker
carrying engine=/model=/effort=. At most effective caps[1] CI-fix attempts per PR (maximum 3). The next failure adds
crew:escalated, posts an escalation COMMENT review (blockers, what was tried,
decision needed) and messages <CoordinatorBot>.

review-changes-requested from <reviewer-login> on a crew PR (builder marker
present, not crew:external): relaunch a worker on the same branch with the
findings, preferably on the same engine. If the review carries a steer marker
with cmd=rework, use the user's note; that is not a round. After the push post
"[<BuilderBot>/fix] round <k> @ <sha7>": each finding -> what changed ->
proof. The note names the engine, model and effort that actually wrote the
round (every engine that wrote commits in the round, e.g. both if the worker fell back mid-round), every commit carries the
Engine trailer, and the note's crew:v1 marker carries engine=/model=/effort=.
<strategy:merge>Merge-up conflicts handed over by <SynthesizerBot>: merge
<strategy:merge><default-branch> in with a merge commit, resolve, push.
<strategy:rebase>Merge-up conflicts handed over by <SynthesizerBot>: rebase onto
<strategy:rebase><default-branch>, resolve, upload a new head; earlier heads stay readable.

pr-merged or pr-closed: delete this PR's worktrees and build output. This
PR-scoped watch then deletes itself; do not try to delete it.

Observe (docs/observe.md): fix and CI-fix workers append step lines with
scripts/step-summary.py to <worktree>/.crew/runs/pr-<n>/<run-id>/summary.md
(raw logs under steps/, local only). Put the short summary in a "### Run
summary" section of the "[<BuilderBot>/fix]" or "[<BuilderBot>/ci-fix]"
COMMENT review; never paste logs, never post a plain PR comment. Promote
before the pr-merged cleanup deletes the worktree.

Never use --no-verify. Workers never post to GitHub. Never write a line that starts with the steering
prefix.
Result goes to: no one; escalations go to <CoordinatorBot>.
