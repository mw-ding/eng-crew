# Coordinator routine: stuck-PR sweeper

Owner: `<CoordinatorBot>`. One scheduled routine per repo. It exists because
event-driven wakes can be missed or can end without progress; the sweep is the
backstop. It is read-only apart from nudges and adding `crew:needs-md`, its
only label write. It runs the coordinator's monitoring duty under the
[owner SLA](../../../docs/protocol.md#6-duties-on-wake-all-roles).

## Trigger

```json
{
  "type": "schedule",
  "cron": "17 * * * *",
  "timezone": "<timezone>"
}
```

Hourly at minute 17, around the clock. The minute is arbitrary; pick one that
does not collide with other schedules. Hourly cadence stretches the thresholds
below (see Notes).

## Prompt

```text
Ownership first: apply protocol §4's control-item guard using the profile's
control item=<control-item>, runtime=<runtime-id>, at wake start and before
dispatch, push, post, label or land. Non-owning, in transit or unreadable:
read/report only. Draining: in-flight writes only, no new pass or land.

Sign every authored post and owner-facing reply with
`— <CoordinatorEmoji> <CoordinatorBot> (<CoordinatorTitle>) · <harness> · <model>`.
Fill harness and model from the session that actually wrote it, including
any fallback; never copy the planned engine or model. Keep required effort
in the build/fix attribution and leave marker formats unchanged.

<include:policy/shared/landing-authority.md>

Sweep open PRs and issues in <owner>/<repo>. Re-read live state every run.
First inspect all crew:hold / crew:escalated items (PRs and issues). Promote
only items whose latest hold/escalation asks the user for a decision, not
lane/dependency holds: those carry a coordinator note naming the blocking
PR/issue. If that user wait is older than 2h of the user's awake hours in PT,
add crew:needs-md unless already present. Use label history to date the current
hold/escalation, not the latest unrelated activity. Preserve existing labels.
Record promotions
in the summary for the coordinator to ping under docs/protocol.md §6's owner
SLA. This is the coordinator's monitoring routine, not a restart of work.

List all crew:hold, crew:escalated and crew:needs-md items in the summary, even
when no promotion is due. Skip those items for all nudge checks below, including
review stalls; an intentional wait is not a missing reviewer acknowledgment.
For remaining items, check open crew PRs and crew:ready issues for stalls.
Also report open issues older than one awake day with no crew:* state label
(summary only, no nudge), for the coordinator's next triage window. State labels
are crew:ready, crew:spec, crew:needs-md, crew:hold, crew:escalated,
crew:in-review, crew:changes and crew:approved; auxiliary labels such as
crew:external and crew:needs-mirror do not count as a triage state.

An eligible item is stuck when:
| Condition                                                                              | Threshold | Wake        |
| changes requested (at head, or carried over a merge-up ack), no builder claim or push  | > 30 min  | builder     |
| CI green at head, no reviewer ack or verdict                                           | > 30 min  | reviewer    |
| approved and green at head, not merged                                                 | > 15 min  | synthesizer (outside the lighter lane, if held only for a missing builder pass=watch marker: builder) |
| conflicting with the base, no merge-up                                                 | > 30 min  | builder (merge-up-only brief) |
| CI failed at head, no ci-fix                                                           | > 20 min  | builder     |
| claimed or acked, no output                                                            | > 3 h     | that bot: check worker liveness, restart in a fresh unique worktree |
| builder claim file for an open crew PR or issue that is not held, escalated, merged or closed, heartbeat older than 15 min (no heartbeat line: file mtime) (condition name builder-silent) | > 15 min | builder: check worker liveness, restart in a fresh unique worktree, may take over the claim |
| crew:ready issue, no PR and no claim                                                   | > 60 min  | builder     |
| open crew PR outside the lighter lane (builder marker present), no B2 watch marker file and no builder pass=watch marker | > 10 min after PR open | builder (parent turn creates B2; condition name no-builder-watch) |

For crew:solo, skip no-builder-watch and builder-silent. Route build, fix,
red CI and conflict refs to <CoordinatorBot> for PR pickup by the owner's
session, never to a builder worker; independent review/land rows still apply.

Judge lighter-lane membership from the full diff at head: only docs, no
code, no .github/, no templates/ and no docs/protocol.md. These PRs install no
B2 and post no pass=watch; exempt them from no-builder-watch and any hold only
for a missing pass=watch marker. The "CI failed at head, no ci-fix" and
"changes requested ... no builder claim or push" rows route lighter-lane
ci-failed / REQUEST_CHANGES to <BuilderBot> by message with PR, head SHA and
failure/findings link. The changes-requested row backs up the reviewer's
verdict-pass message; the CI-failed row is the red-CI backstop because no
listener fires on lighter-lane ci-failed.

For builder-silent, read the claims/builder-* files under
<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/ (the heartbeat: line, else file mtime) and match
each claim to its PR or issue by the pr<n> in the file name
(builder-pr<n>-<sha7>) or issue<n> (builder-issue<n>, the issue-stage claim).
Skip a claim whose PR or issue is merged, closed, held or escalated; that is
cleanup, not silence. A builder push at head, or a comment or review carrying a
hidden `role=builder` crew:v1 marker with the full 40-char head SHA (parse only
the hidden line, protocol §4), within the last 15 min also counts as activity,
so do not flag a claim for work that just posted. The lesson
behind this row is a worker frozen with no bot turn active; a stale heartbeat
distinguishes that from a long but live run.

Nudge by messaging the bot that owns the stage. Do not post to the PR. For
no-builder-watch, ask the builder's parent turn to create B2 for the PR and
verify it; the sweeper cannot create routines. The watch marker file is
<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/watches/pr-<n>.b2.

Dedup: keep <state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/sweeper-state.json keyed by
(item type and number, condition, head SHA for PRs; claim name for issues).
Send at most one nudge per key per 2 hours.
Nudge cap: after the third nudge for the same key with no progress, report it
to the coordinator. The coordinator adds crew:escalated only if the PR is a
crew PR in a loop and escalates on GitHub and in its chat with the user under
docs/protocol.md §6's owner SLA.
Progress means a new marker, a new head SHA, or a changed label.

Promotion is idempotent: re-read labels before writing; never re-add an
existing crew:needs-md. Keep wait timestamps and promotion records in the same
state file; dedup never suppresses an item from the summary.

Result goes to: the coordinator, with stalls, held/needs-md items, promotions
and unlabeled aging issues for the next triage window. Include item links,
wait ages and the open decision where known. The coordinator pings the user
per the owner SLA; the sweeper does not ask the user directly.
Silent only when nothing is stuck AND there is nothing to list.
```

## Notes

- The 2h hold/escalation clock counts only the user's awake hours in PT, as in
  the owner SLA, from the start of the current wait. Pause it outside those
  hours. Issue aging counts awake time since issue creation; one awake day is
  one full user awake-day window, not 24 wall-clock hours. Use the user's awake
  schedule from repo wiring; report unknown timing to the coordinator rather
  than inventing a schedule.
- A PR whose last verdict was `REQUEST_CHANGES` stays in the first row after a
  merge-up ack lands at its head: the ack is not a new verdict.
- A `pass=ack` review never counts as approved. After a clean merge-up of an
  approved PR the reviewer posts a formal re-approve at the new head, so a PR
  still behind on that is caught by the "CI green at head, no reviewer ack or
  verdict" row (reviewer wake).
- Detection window. With the hourly cron, the real detection time for the
  30-min `crew:changes` / no-builder-activity row is 30-90 min (a PR can cross
  the threshold just after a sweep and wait almost a full hour for the next one).
  The same applies to the 10-min `no-builder-watch` row. For repos where that is
  too slow, run the sweeper every 30 min, or add a one-off check about 35 min
  after any `REQUEST_CHANGES`.
- Lighter-lane red CI depends on the sweep or a direct coordinator message.
  With hourly sweeps the 20-min CI-failed threshold means 20-80 min to detect;
  consider a lower threshold or a one-off coordinator check for these PRs.
- `builder-silent` uses the 15-minute silence threshold from the bottleneck
  lesson. With the hourly cron it is detected in 15-75 min; for repos with
  active builds run the sweeper every 15-30 min. Dedup key is
  `(item, builder-silent, head SHA)` for PRs and
  `(issue, builder-silent, claim name)` for issues.
- `no-builder-watch` uses the same dedup key shape `(item, condition, head SHA)`
  and the same nudge cap as the other rows.
- Thresholds are the pilot defaults (added Oct 19, 2026, after the bottleneck
  analysis). Tune them per repo; keep the order of conditions.
- The state file holds only item numbers, condition names, SHAs, timestamps
  and promotion records.
- Weekly intake pass. Once a week (the first run after Monday in
  `<timezone>`), the coordinator runs
  `gh pr list --repo <owner>/<repo> --state open --limit 200 --json number,title,url,labels,updatedAt,isDraft`
  into a temp file and feeds it to `python3 scripts/intake-sweep.py --repo
  <owner>/<repo> <file>`. The output is draft intake cards for open PRs
  labelled `crew:blocked` or idle more than 7 days. The coordinator reviews
  them, drops duplicates, files the keepers as eng-crew issues and accepts or
  closes them in its triage window. The sweeper and the helper only print;
  neither files issues nor edits skills. See
  [self-improve](../../../docs/self-improve.md#weekly-sweep-recipe).
- Metrics refresh. To refresh the cycle-time and rounds table, run
  `python3 scripts/metrics-refresh.py` (read-only, uses `gh` auth). Output goes
  to `docs/metrics/`; see `docs/metrics/README.md`. The coordinator's
  metrics-to-decisions check (`scripts/metrics-decide.py`, gate and waiver in
  `docs/metrics/decisions.md`) reads that CSV; the sweeper only lists an open
  `metrics-gate` issue in its summary and never edits it.
