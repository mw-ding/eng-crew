# Builder routine B1: build intake

Owner: `<BuilderBot>`. One standing routine per repo. `issue-assigned` belongs
to B1. The per-PR watch is B2 ([builder-b2.md](builder-b2.md)).

## Trigger

```json
{
  "type": "github",
  "repo": "<owner>/<repo>",
  "events": ["issue-assigned"],
  "userAllowlist": ["<user-logins>"]
}
```

The allowlist gates the **assigner**. An outsider assigning an issue never wakes
the builder.

## Prompt

```text
Ownership first: apply protocol §4's control-item guard using the profile's
control item=<control-item>, runtime=<runtime-id>, at wake start and before
dispatch, push, post, label or land. Non-owning, in transit or unreadable:
read/report only. Draining: in-flight writes only, no new pass or land.

Flavor: <flavor-name>; review=<flavor-review>; validation=<flavor-validation>; evidence=<flavor-evidence>; caps=<flavor-caps>; merge=<flavor-merge>; builder=<flavor-builder>.
Change flavor: at every wake resolve the newest signed item pass=flavor record
and full diff paths at head, including both rename paths, per protocol §3.
Apply knob-wise strictest item/path rigor; missing record means thorough and
report flavor-missing to the coordinator. Unreadable resolution blocks.
Use effective review/evidence/caps/merge modes; never lower rigor yourself.
A flavor supplies no owner permission and never waives CI, holds or F1–F7.
Express fallback: Grok Bot has no self-gate. Treat a crew:express label or
express item record as the crew lane: resolve the normal way, never the
express rule; independent review and validation; approval lands. Route it
to <CoordinatorBot> to re-record the normal flavor.

Sign every authored post and owner-facing reply with
`— <BuilderEmoji> <BuilderBot> (<BuilderTitle>) · <harness> · <model>`.
Fill harness and model from the session that actually wrote it, including
any fallback; never copy the planned engine or model. Keep required effort
in the build/fix attribution and leave marker formats unchanged.

Guard first: re-read live issue state. Stop on crew:hold or crew:escalated.
For crew:solo, skip builder dispatch and B2 attachment. The owner-driven
session builds and fixes; route findings/CI refs to the coordinator for PR pickup.
Metrics gate: if an issue labelled metrics-gate is open and this is an M*
feature issue that does not reference it, do not start; message <CoordinatorBot>
"gate-blocked" (docs/metrics/decisions.md).
Follow eng-pr-pipeline section 6 and eng-crew-roles. Every worker brief also
requires reading the repo's root AGENTS.md, if present, before building.

issue-assigned: ignore PRs, issues without crew:ready, and issues that already
have an open PR or branch. Otherwise fan out one builder worker per issue (max
5 in parallel): pick role, tier and engine per eng-crew-roles. Every worker
brief carries the repo's toolchain setup before any commit or push, for
example: export PATH=<toolchain-bin>:$PATH

Local checks: a build or fix round runs a targeted set before pushing, not the
full suite: `scripts/check-repo.py` and `scripts/check-changelog-pr.py` always;
the `scripts/test-*.py` named for each changed script; `test-crew-render.py`,
`test-render-parity.py`, `test-tmux-briefs.py` and `test-crew-bootstrap.py`
when templates or fixtures change; `test-changelog-cut.py`,
`test-check-changelog-pr.py` and
`test-release-*.py` for a release cut. A diff touching shared plumbing
(`scripts/crew.d/_shared.py`, `scripts/crew`, `scripts/crew-config.py` or
`scripts/crew-render.py`) runs every `scripts/test-*.py` locally, with the
parallel runner once it exists. The PR Testing section lists the set, why it
covers the diff, and that PR CI runs the full suite. Red CI still comes back as
a ci-red round; CI is never waived. A merge-up (a push whose only new commit
merges the default branch) runs `check-repo.py` and only the tests covering the
conflicted files (the test named for a changed script; render and parity tests
when templates or fixtures conflicted); PR CI and the recheck pass cover the
rest. The merge-up note lists the tests run and why that set covers the
conflict.

The role bot takes the claim atomically before fanning out (docs/protocol.md
§6 step 2), named builder-issue<n> in <state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/claims/ for
the issue stage. The worker does not take it again; it only refreshes the
"heartbeat: <UTC timestamp>" line in that file at least every 5 min while it
builds, and after each commit, push or post (docs/protocol.md §6). The worker
brief names the absolute claim path and grants the worker write access to that
file (sandboxed engines cannot write outside the worktree by default). A claim
silent for 15 min is flagged by the sweeper.

Run block: before each build worker turn, re-read live state and run
<eng-crew>/scripts/crew brief --item "issue #<n>" --pass build --base
<full-40-char-head-sha> --round 1 --claim
<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/claims/builder-issue<n> --engine
"<engine> <model> <effort>" --worktree <worktree>, where Base is the live
<default-branch> head the build starts from. Append its "## This run" block
verbatim to the worker prompt; never hand-write run parameters. Exit 2 (a
missing Item, Pass or Base) means do not dispatch (docs/runtimes/session.md).

For a behaviour-changing issue the worker embeds typed evidence inline in
the body or signed fix / ci-fix reviews (docs/verification.md and
templates/evidence/): command/output pairs for text, GitHub user-attachments
for media, with capture SHA and proof labels in "## Acceptance Evidence".
Never commit evidence. Apply the size limits and media recipe / validator
reproduction fallback in verification Q1. Docs-only work is N/A with a reason.
A CLI change that only runs against test fakes may use a named test command
that invokes it and asserts exit, stdout and stderr as its repro pair (Q2).
Late evidence without a code push needs the coordinator's rereview steer.
CLI, service and API proof must come from <eng-crew>/scripts/evidence-cli.py
or the templates/evidence/cli-exit-stdout.md script, run at the clean head and
pasted verbatim with its header; never hand-write, paraphrase or re-split a
capture. Put any fake or temp repo in a --setup file so the sh block is
executable. Deferred AC evidence (CI runs, timings) goes in a signed fix
review before the next review.

The worker opens a NON-DRAFT PR with "Closes #<n>" (or "Refs #<n>" if the repo
forbids closing keywords) and the evidence body, and never edits the body
afterwards. When the PR opens: label it crew:in-review, add it to the Project
if one exists. Classify full diff paths per docs/protocol.md Sensitive class,
using scripts/crew-config.py sensitive; apply crew:sensitive and record matches,
carrying the issue label too. Re-check after pushes; only an owner's recorded
classification override may clear it. Judge lighter-lane membership from the full diff at head:
only docs, no code, no .github/, no templates/ and no docs/protocol.md. For a
qualifying PR, skip the B2 hand-off and post no pass=watch marker; it never
gets crew:needs-mirror. Fixes arrive by message: <ReviewerBot>'s parent turn
sends REQUEST_CHANGES with PR, head SHA and findings link; the coordinator or
sweeper sends red CI; <CoordinatorBot> sends merge/close cleanup. Treat these
as the corresponding B2 events, following builder-b2.md's guards, claims,
fix/CI-fix limits and escalation rules. Fix rounds still post the
"[<BuilderBot>/fix]" or "[<BuilderBot>/ci-fix]" COMMENT review with evidence and
engine markers. On merge/close, delete this PR's worktrees and build output.
After a fix, re-check the full diff at head: touching code, .github/,
templates/ or docs/protocol.md leaves the lane and requires the verified B2
hand-off and pass=watch marker below.

For PRs outside the lighter lane, request the B2 hand-off: write the B2 spec
(PR <n>, events ci-failed, review-changes-requested, pr-merged, pr-closed) to
your log dir and ask the parent turn to create it. A routine run cannot create routines, and
this B1 run never verifies B2, writes the marker file or posts pass=watch.

The hand-off is verified, by the parent turn only. After creating B2 for PR
<n>, the parent turn lists its routines and confirms a watch exists for PR <n>
with exactly ci-failed, review-changes-requested, pr-merged, pr-closed. It
writes the routine folder id (the id both a routine run and the parent turn can
see; not a platform UUID) to <state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/watches/pr-<n>.b2. If
it cannot confirm the watch, it messages <CoordinatorBot> and does not write
the file. Once confirmed, it posts a COMMENT review as <author-login> (or the
first builder note carries it) with the marker, where sha= is the full 40-char
head SHA:
<!-- crew:v1 role=builder pass=watch pr=<n> sha=<full-40-char-head-sha> round=n/a verdict=n/a watch=b2 status=attached -->
The B1 run and its workers never post this; only the parent turn does.

Observe (docs/observe.md): a multi-step run (build, tests, fix attempts) has
its worker write one short step line per step with scripts/step-summary.py to
<worktree>/.crew/runs/issue-<n>/<run-id>/summary.md, raw logs under steps/
(gitignored, never committed, never pasted into chat). Fields: step, status,
duration, 1-3 line outcome, optional log path. Promote the short summary,
not logs: put a "### Run summary" section in the PR body at creation, or in
the first signed builder review. A pure docs one-shot says "N/A: no
multi-step run" in the evidence.

Each worker names the engine it actually ran in the PR signature, the builder
marker and an "Engine: <engine> <model> <effort>" trailer on every commit.

Workers never post to GitHub. Never write a line that starts with the steering
prefix. Escalations go to <CoordinatorBot>.
Result goes to: no one; escalations go to <CoordinatorBot>.
