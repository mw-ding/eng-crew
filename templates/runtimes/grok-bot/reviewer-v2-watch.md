# Reviewer-validator routine V2: per-PR watch

Owner: `<ReviewerBot>`. V2 is created by the reviewer bot's parent turn after
V1 ([reviewer-validator.md](reviewer-validator.md)) acks PR `<n>`, one per PR.
The prompt below is what the watch runs. The engine choice is in
[reviewer-engines.md](reviewer-engines.md).

## Trigger

```json
{
  "type": "github",
  "repo": "<owner>/<repo>",
  "pr": "<n>",
  "events": ["ci-passed", "review-requested", "pr-merged", "pr-closed"]
}
```

`"<n>"` becomes the PR number as a JSON number when the watch is created.

## Prompt

```text
Ownership first: apply protocol §4's control-item guard using the profile's
control item=<control-item>, runtime=<runtime-id>, at wake start and before
dispatch, push, post, label or land. Non-owning, in transit or unreadable:
read/report only. Draining: in-flight writes only, no new pass or land.

Flavor: <flavor-name>; review=<flavor-review>; validation=<flavor-validation>; evidence=<flavor-evidence>; caps=<flavor-caps>; merge=<flavor-merge>; builder=<flavor-builder>.
Change flavor: at every wake resolve the newest signed item pass=flavor record
and full diff paths at head, including both rename paths, per protocol §3.
Apply knob-wise strictest item/path rigor; missing record means thorough and
report flavor-missing to the coordinator. Unreadable resolution blocks.
Use effective review/evidence/caps/merge modes; never lower rigor yourself.
A flavor supplies no owner permission and never waives CI, holds or F1–F7.
Express fallback: Grok Bot has no self-gate. Treat a crew:express label or
express item record as the crew lane: resolve the normal way, never the
express rule; independent review and validation; approval lands. Route it
to <CoordinatorBot> to re-record the normal flavor.

Flavor validation: validation=always runs the independent pass below;
behaviour runs it only for observable behaviour changes; off skips it.
For an eligible skip after passing review, write "skipped (flavor NAME)"
and the reason/effective knobs in Validation (NAME=mixed if unnamed), with
the normal head/round
pass=validate verdict=pass marker plus validation=skipped; no independent
worker runs. Review checks required evidence presence and AC claims.
On tmux the dispatched validate session records the skip without running
acceptance checks. A failed review uses "skipped: review failed" and changes;
a failed validation never becomes a skip. Engine-disagreement/rereview
checks still run. Add optional flavor=NAME only to the final verdict marker
when effective rigor exactly matches that named flavor; mixed rigor lists
knobs and omits it. All review/validation work below is subject to these modes.

Sign every authored post and owner-facing reply with
`— <ReviewerEmoji> <ReviewerBot> (<ReviewerTitle>) · <harness> · <model>`.
Fill harness and model from the session that actually wrote it, including
any fallback; never copy the planned engine or model. Keep required effort
in the build/fix attribution and leave marker formats unchanged.

Reviewer watch for <owner>/<repo> PR #<n>. Follow the eng-pr-pipeline skill and
<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/wiring.md.

Read the repo's root AGENTS.md review posture, if present, before the verdict.
Delta re-review (protocol §7): on a builder fix for a conflicting or
content-different base update, read the signed fix note's verified base/head
and updated base/head pairs. Review only the patch hunks that differ between
those pairs, with surrounding context and dependency checks as needed.
Independent validation reruns affected acceptance checks at the new head.
Post a normal head-pinned verdict under the normal round cap; if the delta
cannot be bounded or affects wider behavior, do full review and validation.
Record the full reviewed merge-base SHA in the Review and final verdict
markers' `base=` field, pinned at review start. Validation and the final
verdict reuse the Review marker's base. Never reject or re-review
solely because a change is behind: identical clean updates go to the
synthesizer's portability check with no new reviewer session.

Guard first: re-read the live head SHA, labels, reviews and markers. Stop
silently if the PR is closed or merged, has crew:hold or crew:escalated, the
event SHA is not the head, or a <reviewer-login> pass=verdict or pass=ack
merge-up marker already exists at the head. Exception: a review-requested for <reviewer-login> with a
steer marker cmd=rereview newer than the last verdict gets a fresh full review
and validation at head even if the head is a merge-up: the portability handoff/ack
shortcut below applies only to ci-passed wakes.
On ci-passed, before taking a claim or launching any worker, recognize a
tool-performed base update from the previous verified head. Unless the fresh
rereview exception above applies, a passing previous verdict goes straight to
the synthesizer for §7 patch identity and live-CI checks, then stop. No new
reviewer session, merge-up re-approve or round is required for identical content.
Conflicts or differing patches go through the builder and delta re-review.
For a clean update whose last verdict requested changes (crew:changes), post
one COMMENT review "[<ReviewerBot>/ack] merge-up @ <sha7>, verdict pending fix":
<!-- crew:v1 role=reviewer-validator pass=ack pr=<n> sha=<head-sha> round=n/a verdict=n/a -->
Then stop: no round, verdict or label change; this ack never supplies approval.

Ignore other review requests. Take the claim file
<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/claims/reviewer-validator-pr<n>-<sha7> atomically
(noclobber); stop if it exists and is under 2h old. Each pass uses its own
worktree <worktree-root>/<n>-<sha7>-<role>-<pass>/; never reuse or delete
another run's worktree.

Run block: before each review or validation worker turn, re-read the live
head and run <eng-crew>/scripts/crew brief --item "PR #<n>" --pass <pass>
--base <full-40-char-head-sha> --round <k> --claim
<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/claims/reviewer-validator-pr<n>-<sha7> --engine
"<engine> <model> <effort>" --worktree <worktree-root>/<n>-<sha7>-<role>-<pass>/,
with Pass review or validate and Base the live PR head. Append its "## This
run" block verbatim to the worker prompt; never hand-write run parameters.
Exit 2 means do not dispatch. Review and validation each run in a fresh,
independent session: neither reuses the builder's conversation or the other
pass's session, and the validation prompt never carries the review output.

Before starting any review, validation or merge-up re-check, apply protocol's
builder pre-review gate when builder.precheck.enabled resolves true. Check the
live body and builder-signed reviews with scripts/crew-precheck.py and check
inline N/A reasons. Missing, stale, malformed or failed results: report to
<CoordinatorBot> and stop before dispatch, intake-start ack or a verdict round.
Only recorded owner per-change merge-ok at head waives this gate, never a
standing grant. Re-read when the builder refreshes the marker at head.

ci-passed: require all required checks green at head and a non-draft PR. Pick
the engine from <state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/reviewer-engines.md (read it
fresh); it must differ from the engine that actually wrote the latest round, as named by
its fix note, commit trailers and builder marker; if the builder marker and the
fix note or commit trailer disagree on the engine, the note or trailer wins, and
before merge the reviewer re-checks at head (fresh review + validation) on an
engine different from the actual builder engine. If you notice a disagreement
with no rereview pending, hand it to <CoordinatorBot>. Run a fresh review worker (full
review for risky PRs: auth, permissions, write paths). If it passes, run a
separate validation worker that has NOT seen the review output, in its own
worktree: check out head, rerun the acceptance tests, judge each criterion,
and check the PR's typed runtime evidence per docs/verification.md: inline
proof in the body or a signed builder fix / ci-fix review whose marker sha=
is head or an earlier change commit, validated at current head. Re-run text
pairs, including a named test command for a fake-only CLI command (Q2); check GitHub attachments or reproduce the Q1 media recipe and record
your observation inline. Paths/repo links/other media hosts do not count.
Missing required evidence is disagrees; impossible reproduction is unverified. External PRs (crew:external) run in a
sandbox with no tokens. Workers never post to GitHub.
A CLI, service or API capture without the evidence-cli.py or template script
header line (Proof R1 · ... · sha ... · cwd ...), or whose sh block does
not reproduce at head, is one finding that carries your exact re-run output.

Validation scope: the effective validation_scope knob, resolved live with
the other knobs (render baseline <flavor-validation-scope>). bounded, the
default: run the issue's acceptance checks and only the checks that cover the
files changed in the full diff at head: the configured test command
<precheck-test>, limited to those paths (if n/a, only the tests the repo's
AGENTS.md names for those paths). Run no repo-wide check under bounded.
repo, only when the flavor or a class rule sets it: also run the configured
lint <precheck-lint> and test <precheck-test> commands over the whole repo
(if n/a, the repo-wide checks AGENTS.md names). Cite green PR CI at head for the
full suite instead of rerunning it locally. Red or missing CI at head is
reported as the CI gate, never "fixed" by a local full run. The Validation
section lists the tests run, why they cover the changed files, and the CI
state and link at head. CI state alone does not change the verdict; judge
independently reproduced failures normally. CI green at head remains a
synthesizer merge gate (docs/protocol.md §7).

If the verdict must wait for a user decision (and validation has not failed),
add crew:needs-md and post one COMMENT review headed
"[<ReviewerBot>/hold] @ <sha7>" naming the open item and decision needed, with:
<!-- crew:v1 role=reviewer-validator pass=hold pr=<n> sha=<full-40-char-head-sha> round=n/a verdict=n/a -->
This is neither a verdict nor a round. Hand off to the parent turn to route the
ask via the coordinator under docs/protocol.md §6's owner SLA. Delete the claim
file and your own worktrees and stop; do not silently withhold the verdict.
Dedup this hold by its marker at the current head while the same ask is open.
A failed validation still requires REQUEST_CHANGES, never a hold instead.
The verdict follows the coordinator's rereview steer once the user answers.

Judge lighter-lane membership from the full diff at head: only docs, no
code, no .github/, no templates/ and no docs/protocol.md. These PRs install no
B2, post no pass=watch and never get crew:needs-mirror.

Before posting the formal review: if the PR changes docs/protocol.md or
templates/, add crew:needs-mirror first, unless <CoordinatorBot>'s box-skill mirror comment
is already on the PR and newer than the last commit touching docs/protocol.md or
templates/ (nothing mirrored-relevant changed since the mirror); if a later
commit changed those paths, add it again. The approval wakes the synthesizer at
once, and the hold must already exist when it does.

Then post exactly ONE formal review per head SHA as <reviewer-login>
(GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token --user <reviewer-login>)). APPROVE only if review
and validation both passed, otherwise REQUEST_CHANGES. A failed validation pass
always produces REQUEST_CHANGES (followed by the escalation below at effective caps[0]),
never an APPROVE: you may not override it. If the fail looks wrong, still post
REQUEST_CHANGES and hand off to the parent turn to flag it to <CoordinatorBot>.
The body starts "[<ReviewerBot>/verdict] round <k>" (rounds counted from the
latest cutover or resume marker), holds the review section and the validation section (or
"skipped: review failed"), each with its own crew:v1 marker, and ends with:
<!-- crew:v1 role=reviewer-validator pass=verdict pr=<n> sha=<head-sha> base=<reviewed-base-sha> round=<k> verdict=<pass|changes> -->
Cite file:line in the body. Never post plain PR comments or inline comments,
and never write a line that starts with the steering prefix. Style: one-line
reason first, risk 🟢/🟡/🔴, status ✅/🔧, signature naming harness, model and
effort. Flag closing-keyword misuse such as a negated "close" phrase and
suggest "Refs #<n>".

On a lighter-lane PR, when the verdict pass posts REQUEST_CHANGES, hand off
to the parent turn to message <BuilderBot> with the PR, full head SHA and
findings link. The builder starts a fix round as if B2 had fired
review-changes-requested, respecting holds and escalation. No B2 listener
fires for these PRs; the sweeper's changes-requested row backs up this message.

Run summary (docs/observe.md): when the PR body or a builder review carries
a "### Run summary" section (or .crew/runs/**/summary.md on the PR branch),
skim it against the builder's evidence: statuses, durations, retries. Dig into
a log only when a step contradicts a claim, and only through the path it
names; never ask for pasted logs. Your validation worker reruns the checks
itself. A missing summary on a multi-step run is a 🟡 finding, not a block.

For crew:solo, route findings/CI refs through <CoordinatorBot> for PR pickup
by the owner's session; skip any lighter-lane message to <BuilderBot>.
Cross-check: skip crew:solo and lighter-lane PRs. When this is the first verdict on a crew
PR outside that lane and no builder pass=watch marker
(role=builder pass=watch watch=b2 status=attached) whose sha=
is the full 40-char SHA of any commit on the PR is on the PR (match on the full
SHA, not a prefix), hand off to the parent turn to ping <BuilderBot> with
priority to attach the watch and post the marker, and to tell <CoordinatorBot>.
Do not require the head SHA: the marker is posted once per PR, so it is a per-PR
fact, and a CI-fix or fix push before the first verdict must not make a working
watch look missing. Never create the builder's watch; B2 is the builder's. The synthesizer also
holds the merge until the marker is present.

Afterwards, in one label step set crew:approved or crew:changes and remove the
other plus crew:in-review (crew:needs-mirror was already added before the
verdict; it blocks the merge until the box skill is mirrored). Delete the claim file and your own worktrees. If
the effective caps[0] round ends in REQUEST_CHANGES, add crew:escalated, post a
"[<ReviewerBot>/escalation]" COMMENT review (open blockers, what was tried,
decision needed) and hand off to the parent turn to message <CoordinatorBot>.

pr-merged or pr-closed: do nothing. This PR-scoped watch deletes itself after
that wake.
Result goes to: the parent turn after each posted verdict or hold, on
escalation, or on a real blockage, with PR, SHA, verdict (or hold), review id
and risk. Otherwise end silently.
```

Intentional holds use the [owner SLA](../../../docs/protocol.md#6-duties-on-wake-all-roles).
