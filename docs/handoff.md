How the owner pauses one crew runtime on a repo and resumes the same work
in another, for example from the Grok Bot crew to a Claude Code or Codex
session (tmux or the session runtime) when orchestration quota runs short,
and back again (roadmap 21.1,
[#157](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/157); umbrella
[#110](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/110)). It carries out the
owner's
[#160 row 16 decision](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/160#issuecomment-6532279114)
and does not re-decide it: keep #157's cross-runtime scope, and adopt
read-only fallback, dependency-closed idempotent transfer, retry-until-ack
with a handoff id and prompt stop of the outgoing runtime's wake sources.

The ownership record and guards are implemented by #210 in
[protocol §4](protocol.md#ownership-record), the manifest generator by
[#211](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/211) ([Manifest](#manifest)),
and on tmux the resume, hold lift and prompt stop by
[#212](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/212)
([Resume and reconcile](#resume-and-reconcile), [Prompt stop](#prompt-stop)).
The remaining transfer flow below is a design: this page itself adds no
rule, gate, cap or label. It proposes them, and each lands through the [build issues](#build-issues); a change to
what satisfies a gate lands under the
[gate contract](protocol.md#gate-contract) with the owner's merge-ok. Until
then [protocol §8](protocol.md#8-safety) applies as written (only one
automation system may own a repo at a time), and a switch is the manual
pause each binding declares under
[C9](runtimes/README.md#c9-ownership-handoff). GitHub stays the tool of
record (invariant I5).

## Overview

```text
outgoing A                     control item (tool of record)             incoming B
owner: "/crew handoff to B" →  [A/handoff] draining
drain or stop own runs
manifest + offer            →  [A/handoff] offered  (manifest inside)
read-only, waits for ack                                                  install, reconcile
                               [B/handoff] acked                       ←  ack once per id
prompt stop of wake sources →  [A/handoff] stopped                        lift handoff holds,
                                                                          continue each stage
```

| # | Step | Who | Ends with |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Pause and drain](#pause-and-drain) | Outgoing coordinator, on the owner's command | No run of the outgoing runtime in flight |
| 2 | [Manifest](#manifest) | Outgoing coordinator | One `offered` post carrying the manifest; the outgoing runtime is read-only |
| 3 | [Resume and reconcile](#resume-and-reconcile) | Incoming coordinator | One `acked` post; the incoming runtime owns the repo |
| 4 | [Prompt stop](#prompt-stop) | Outgoing runtime | No wake source of the outgoing runtime can start a pass; a `stopped` post |
| 5 | [Return path](#return-path) | Both, reversed | The same flow from B back to A |

When the outgoing runtime cannot act (quota out, crashed, unreachable), the
owner commands a **takeover** in the incoming runtime instead of steps 1–2.

## Owner assumption

The owner's assumption for #213 (2026-11-03): "When we say handoff it means
from one full eng-crew team handoff to another eng-crew team in a different
session. … But the assumption is under the hood that the eng-crew skills
are the same." Skill and version parity between the two teams is a
precondition, not part of the handoff. The
[environment decision](https://github.com/mw-ding/mdstack/issues/213#issuecomment-6618452050)
replaced the example (the owner's Slack team) with a crew-controlled
second team. The dry run therefore uses two tmux teams on one Mac, each
with its own session, state and runtime instance, on one sandbox repo
([campaign A29](campaign-harness.md#a29)). Each manifest records its
sender's `eng_crew_version`, so the round trip records both sides'
versions.

## Decisions

Rows citing row 16 restate the owner's decision; the others are this
design's choices within it, including answers to #157's open questions
Q1–Q5.

| Question | Decision | Alternatives considered | Section |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scope (row 16 #1) | Between runtime instances on one repo, both ways | Within one runtime only (firstmate's restart and backlog handoffs): does not move work between Grok Bot and a session | [Overview](#overview) |
| Unit of ownership | The repo: one owning runtime instance at a time ([§8](protocol.md#8-safety)). A crew serving several repos hands each off separately | Per item, as today's #111 lane split does by hand (`crew:hold` on roadmap PRs for Grok Bot, `hold_label_blocks = false` for the session): two crews race on land order, update-branch and shared state tags; with a record, the split becomes a handoff. Per crew: one diverged repo blocks the others | [Ownership record](#ownership-record) |
| Where ownership lives | `pass=handoff` markers on one control item per repo, read in post order | A file on a `crew/state` branch: a push is an atomic compare-and-swap, but it may run CI on push, notifies nobody and branch rules may block it. A repo variable or description: not append-only, no audit trail. A local state file: invisible to a runtime on another host (I5) | [Ownership record](#ownership-record) |
| Non-owner (row 16 #2) | Read-only: reads and reports, never starts a pass, posts a pass marker, tags or lands. An unreadable record is read-only for that wake | Stop entirely: the outgoing coordinator could not see the ack. Warn only: two crews act | [Ownership record](#ownership-record) |
| Drain or hard stop (#157 Q1) | The owner's choice: `drain` (default; nothing new starts, runs end by themselves, deadline 30 minutes, then `stop`) or `stop` (kill runs now, keeping unlanded work). A land past its final gate re-check always finishes. `takeover` when the outgoing runtime cannot act | Always drain: a runtime out of quota may never finish. Always hard stop: discards a review minutes from its verdict. Per-pass safe points: not needed, because every external effect is atomic except a land | [Pause and drain](#pause-and-drain) |
| Per-item holds | None by default: the ownership record is the hold. `crew:hold` only for a runtime whose guard predates #210, listed in the manifest so that only those holds are lifted | A hold label on every item (the issue's first shape): many writes, handoff holds look like owner holds, and a tmux crew with `hold_label_blocks = false` ignores it. A new `crew:handoff` label: a second record of what the marker already says | [Pause and drain](#pause-and-drain) |
| Manifest location (#157 Q2; row 16 #7) | On the control item, in the same post as the `offered` marker | A `crew/state` branch file (as above). The umbrella or milestone issue: many comments to page through on every guard read, and it closes. A local outbox file: scratch only (row 16 #7) | [Manifest](#manifest) |
| Manifest format | A short human summary plus one fenced JSON block, references only | TOML: no stdlib writer. YAML: no stdlib parser. Prose only: not machine-readable | [Manifest](#manifest) |
| What moves (row 16 #3) | Dependency-closed sets; the incoming runtime adopts or holds whole sets and skips what it already owns | Item by item: a stacked change or a merge train split by a hold breaks its order. All or nothing: one diverged item blocks the whole handoff | [Resume and reconcile](#resume-and-reconcile) |
| Delivery proof (row 16 #4) | An `acked` marker keyed by the handoff id. Both sides re-read before posting and retry until posted, so a retry is never a second handoff | A message between runtimes: no channel spans two runtimes ([C3](runtimes/README.md#c3-messages-by-reference-with-proof-of-delivery) is within one). No id: a retried offer looks like a new handoff | [Ownership record](#ownership-record) |
| Old runtime stops (row 16 #5) | Read-only from `offered` (from `takeover` in a takeover); wake sources stop after `acked`. Grok Bot routines no-op at once, then are removed | Drain, then stop, with no prompt rule: a lingering watcher or routine acts after ownership moved. Keep no-op routines for good: each event still costs a bot turn ([#109](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/109)) | [Prompt stop](#prompt-stop) |
| Truth after handoff (row 16 #6) | Live state wins; the manifest is a hint. A pass marker posted while ownership is in transit is re-run, not trusted | Manifest as truth: stale the moment it is posted | [Resume and reconcile](#resume-and-reconcile) |
| Rounds | A handoff never resets rounds: it posts no per-change `cutover` or `resume` marker | A `cutover` per change: resets the round count ([§5](protocol.md#5-rounds-and-escalation)), so a handoff would escape the round cap | [Resume and reconcile](#resume-and-reconcile) |
| Session rules (#157 Q3; row 16 #8) | Rules live in the profile and flavors; the manifest lists their resolved values, and links only to rules not yet in config. A difference is an owner ask before the ack | Rules as manifest text: comment threads again. The incoming runtime adopts the outgoing's rules: a rule changes without the owner | [Session rules as config](#session-rules-as-config) |
| Marker and guard placement (#157 Q4) | One new pass value, `handoff`, with a `state` field. Guard at [§6](protocol.md#6-duties-on-wake-all-roles) step 1 and again right before each push, post and land. Contract capability C9 | A `pass=owner` marker beside `pass=handoff`: two values for one record. Guard at wake start only: a long pass could land after ownership moved | [Ownership record](#ownership-record), [Runtime guards](#runtime-guards) |
| Grok Bot on a handoff marker (#157 Q5) | Every routine's guard no-ops; the parent turns then remove the routines; the return re-creates them and backfills the per-PR watches | Remove routines only: a routine missed in removal still acts. Guard only: no-op wakes keep costing turns | [Runtime guards](#runtime-guards), [Return path](#return-path) |
| Owner command channel | The coordinator chat (the owner channel); the coordinator records each command in its state post with `cmd-id=chat` | A `/crew` comment on the control item: no issue-comment event wakes anyone, so it waits for the next guard read, and it is a second command channel to secure | [Pause and drain](#pause-and-drain) |
| Core or runtime contract (AC2) | Both: the record, the guard and the gate are core; the mechanics are runtime capability C9 | All core: the protocol would name watchers and routines again, which #114 moved out. Fold into C1: C1 wakes; C9 also drains and stops | [Runtime contract](#runtime-contract) |
| Quota trigger (#157 item 6) | The coordinator suggests a handoff; it never switches by itself | Automatic switching: out of scope | [Quota suggestion](#quota-suggestion) |

## Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Runtime instance | One running crew, written `<runtime>@<instance>`, for example `grok-bot@box`, `tmux@laptop` or `session@laptop`. `<runtime>` is the profile's `runtime.name` (or `session` for a coordinator session that has no binding yet); `<instance>` is a short label the owner picks (proposed key `runtime.instance`), never a host name or path. Two tmux crews on two hosts are two instances, so moving a [multi-device](runtimes/multi-device.md) primary is a handoff |
| Control item | One long-lived tracker item per repo that holds the ownership record and the manifests. On GitHub an issue, with its conversation locked to collaborators. Named by the proposed profile key `repo.control_item` |
| Ownership record | The `pass=handoff` markers on the control item, read in post order |
| Owning runtime | The runtime instance the record names; the only one that may act on the repo. "The owner" still means the human |
| Handoff id | `<yyyymmdd>-<6 hex>`, chosen by the side that opens the handoff; every post of that handoff carries it |
| Set | A dependency-closed group of open items: an issue and its change, plus every open item joined to it by `Depends on`, a stacked base or a merge train |
| Read-only | Reads live state and reports; never starts a pass, pushes, posts a pass marker, sets or clears a state tag, assigns, creates a watch or lands |

## Ownership record

Every state is one coordinator post on the control item, with the signed
header and hidden line of [§4](protocol.md#4-marker-conventions):

```text
[<CoordinatorBot>/handoff] <state> <from> → <to> (<handoff-id>)
<the owner's command or the reason, one line>
<!-- crew:v1 role=coordinator pass=handoff handoff=<handoff-id> state=<state> from=<runtime-id> to=<runtime-id> cmd-id=<cmd-id> sha=<default-branch-head-sha> round=n/a verdict=n/a -->
```

`sha=` is the full default-branch head when the post is made. `cmd-id` is
`chat` for a command given in the coordinator chat, else `n/a`.

| `state` | Posted by | When | Owning runtime after it | Who may act |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claimed` | The first runtime to start on a repo with no record (`from=none`) | At start, when the control item has no `pass=handoff` marker | `to` | `to` |
| `draining` | Outgoing coordinator | The owner's handoff command | `from` | `from`, but it starts no new pass |
| `offered` | Outgoing coordinator | Drain done; the post carries the manifest | In transit | Nobody; `to` reconciles (reads only) |
| `takeover` | Incoming coordinator | The owner's takeover command, when `from` cannot act | In transit | Nobody; `to` reconciles |
| `acked` | Incoming coordinator | Reconcile done | `to` | `to` |
| `stopped` | Outgoing coordinator | Its wake sources are stopped | Unchanged | Unchanged |
| `aborted` | The side that opened the handoff | The owner's abort, before `acked` | `from` | `from` |

The owning runtime is a pure function of the record:

1. Only well-formed markers posted on the control item by a login in the
   reading profile's `identities` or `owners` count. Others are ignored and
   reported to the owner.
2. The earliest `claimed` wins when no earlier marker exists; a later
   `claimed` is ignored. This tie-break settles two runtimes starting at
   once, since the backends offer no atomic lock
   ([multi-device](runtimes/multi-device.md#decisions)).
3. One handoff is open at a time. `draining` or `takeover` opens one;
   `acked` or `aborted` closes it. An opener whose `from` is not the owning
   runtime, or a second opener while one is open, is ignored and reported.
   The exception is a `takeover` with the open handoff's id, after its
   `draining` or `offered`: the outgoing runtime stopped answering mid-way.
4. `acked` counts only with the open id and its `to`; the first one wins.
5. `pass=handoff` markers sit on the control item, not on a change, so they
   never touch a change's round count.

**Guard.** Each role reads the record at
[§6](protocol.md#6-duties-on-wake-all-roles) step 1, and again right before
each push, post and land, as the synthesizer already re-reads before it
merges:

| The record says | This runtime |
|---|---|
| No record (no control item set, or no marker) | Acts as today; `mdstack doctor` warns. Its first start after a control item exists posts `claimed` |
| Owning, no open handoff | Acts |
| Owning, `draining` | Finishes in-flight passes; starts nothing |
| In transit, and this runtime is `to` | Reconciles (reads only), then posts `acked` |
| Anything else | Read-only |
| Unreadable (API error) | Read-only for this wake; the next wake retries |

A read-only coordinator still talks to the owner (the repo is owned by
`<runtime-id>`), and posts only its side's handoff states: `offered`,
`stopped` or `aborted` as the outgoing side, `takeover` or `acked` as the
incoming side.
Owner-SLA duties ([§6](protocol.md#6-duties-on-wake-all-roles)) belong to
the owning runtime; an auto-apply time that passes while ownership is in
transit is applied by the incoming runtime right after its ack.

**Gate contract for #210.** Landing only as the owning runtime is a new
[§7](protocol.md#7-merge-gate-synthesizer) gate, so #210 states it in the
same change and needs the owner's merge-ok:

| Gate | Satisfied by | Who / how fast | Fail-open | Binding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Owning runtime | The ownership record names this runtime instance with no handoff open, or no record exists | The owner commands; coordinators post within a turn | The owner aborts the open handoff (the outgoing runtime owns again) or commands a takeover (the incoming owns); no merge-ok or standing grant lands as a non-owner; CI is never waived | core |

## Pause and drain

The owner gives the command in the coordinator chat:
`/crew handoff to <runtime-id> [drain | stop] [deadline <minutes>]`, or
`/crew handoff abort`, or, to the incoming coordinator,
`/crew takeover from <runtime-id>`. The coordinator records it in the state
post (bot text never starts with `/crew`).

| Mode | Use | In-flight runs | Ends when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `drain` (default) | A planned switch | Run to their end; nothing new starts, lands included | Every run has ended, or the deadline (default 30 minutes) passes; then as `stop` |
| `stop` | Quota is out now | Killed now; worktrees with unlanded work stay ([C6](runtimes/README.md#c6-isolation)); a land past its final gate re-check finishes | The land lock is free |
| `takeover` | The outgoing runtime cannot act | Untouched; each one's guard turns it read-only at its next check | The incoming runtime's ack |

`stop` is safe at any moment because every external effect is atomic: a
push lands whole or not at all, and so does a post. The one multi-step
sequence is a land (the merge, then the `merge` post) under the land lock;
the owning-runtime check is part of its final gate re-check, and past that
re-check it finishes. What a stopped run leaves, and what the incoming
runtime does:

| Pass in flight | Drain | Stop leaves | Incoming runtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| Builder build, fix or ci-fix | Finishes the round: push and fix note | Pushed commits, perhaps no fix note; unpushed work in the kept worktree | Continues the round at the branch head and posts the note; lists the kept worktree for the owner |
| Review or validation | Posts its verdict | No verdict at head | Runs the pass at head (no marker at head, §6 step 2) |
| Land past its final re-check | Finishes | Finishes | Close-out from live state if the `merge` post is missing |
| Merge train ([tmux](runtimes/tmux.md#mdstack-train)) | Finishes the train | The whole train stops | Re-checks the train's PRs as one set |
| Coordinator turn | Finishes | Ends after its current post | Reconciles |

**Holds.** No per-item label by default: the record stops every runtime
whose guard reads it. For a runtime whose guard predates #210 (Grok Bot
until #140 deploys the new render), the outgoing coordinator, or the
incoming one in a takeover, adds `crew:hold` to each open crew item without
one and lists exactly those items in the manifest's `holds_added`, so the
incoming runtime lifts only what the handoff added.

Outgoing coordinator, in order:

1. Post `draining` with the mode and deadline.
2. Drain or stop its runs; release its claims.
3. Generate the [manifest](#manifest) from live state and its own run
   records, and post it with `offered`. From here it is read-only.
4. Check for the ack on its backstop (the tmux watcher backstop, the Grok
   Bot sweeper). With no ack after the owner SLA's 2 awake hours, remind
   the owner how to start the incoming runtime. Re-post the same `offered`
   only if the earlier post is missing on re-read; never open a second
   handoff while one is open.
5. On `acked`: [prompt stop](#prompt-stop), then post `stopped`.

## Manifest

One post on the control item: the human summary, the JSON block, then the
`offered` marker. In a takeover the incoming runtime runs the same
generator from live state and posts the result with its `acked`, so the
record holds a manifest either way.

| #157 asks for | Field |
|---|---|
| Per open issue or PR: stage, head SHA, last verdict and round, pending owner decisions, in-flight claims | `sets[].items[]`: `stage`, `pr`, `head`, `verdict`, `ci`, `labels`, `owner_asks`, `runs` |
| Active milestone and dependency order | `milestone`, `sets[].order`, `items[].depends_on` |
| Active session rules and standing grants, with links | `rules`, `links` ([Session rules as config](#session-rules-as-config)) |
| Backlog | `backlog` |
| Known gotchas | `gotchas` |

Rules:

- **References only:** item and PR numbers, full SHAs, links, worktree
  names, profile keys. Never a diff, log, chat quote, token or real path
  (spec R1, R2). The generator runs the
  [secret scan](../scripts/README.md#what-it-checks) patterns on the post
  and refuses on a match.
- **From live state, not memory:** items, labels, heads, CI and verdicts
  from the backend; runs from the runtime's own records; owner asks from
  their posts, with each deadline unchanged.
- **One post:** within the backend's post limit (65,536 characters on
  GitHub). If it would not fit, `backlog` shrinks to one link per milestone;
  an open item is never dropped.
- **Versioned:** `schema` is `crew-handoff/1`. A reader refuses an unknown
  major version and asks the owner.

**Generator (#211).** On tmux, `mdstack handoff manifest` fills
[templates/handoff-manifest.md](../templates/handoff-manifest.md) for this
runtime's open `draining` handoff: open crew items, open PRs and their open
`Depends on` / `Closes` items as sets, stage, head, labels, runs from its run
records (worktree name only), the resolved `flavor.*` and merge grant rules,
and the backlog. With `--post` it re-reads the record before every attempt
and posts only while no `offered` post with that id exists, so a retried or
timed-out post is never a second one; after `acked` it posts nothing.
`mdstack handoff reconcile` is the incoming side's read-only plan: per set
`adopt`, `hold` (an open PR's head moved since the manifest) or `skip`
(every item already claimed here), plus `missed` crew items; #212 extends
it to the whole [reconcile table](#resume-and-reconcile). Verdicts, CI,
owner asks, milestone and gotchas fields are not generated yet.

````

`stage` is a state tag name without `crew:` (`ready`, `in-review`,
`changes`, `approved`, `hold`, `escalated`, `needs-md`), or `build` for an
assigned item with no change yet. A run's `end` is `done`, `stopped` or
`kept` (unlanded work left in that worktree).

## Resume and reconcile

Incoming coordinator, in order:

1. **Install.** `mdstack bootstrap` with the project profile
   ([bootstrap](bootstrap.md), #144), or `mdstack doctor` on an existing
   install; the self-test passes and `runtime.instance` is set.
2. **Find the handoff.** The open handoff whose `to` is this runtime, in
   state `offered`; or, on the owner's command, post `takeover` (reusing
   the open handoff's id if there is one).
3. **Reconcile** each set against live state (the table below), reading
   only. The manifest is a hint; live state wins. A diverged set is only
   planned as held here.
4. **Rules.** Compare the manifest's `rules` with its own resolved profile.
   Any difference is an owner ask before the ack; the incoming runtime
   never silently adopts or drops a rule.
5. **Ready its wake sources** ([Return path](#return-path) for Grok Bot;
   `mdstack up` for tmux).
6. **Ack.** Re-read the record; if an `acked` with this id exists, stop.
   Otherwise post `acked`, and retry until it is posted. Then, before any
   dispatch, apply the holds planned in step 3 (`crew:hold` with a
   coordinator note), so no diverged set is adopted with the others.
   On tmux, then run `mdstack up` again: before the ack it started
   only window 0 and refused the leads, and now that this runtime owns
   the repo it starts each enabled lead that is missing (#1082).
7. **Lift holds.** Remove `crew:hold` from the `holds_added` items only
   once the outgoing runtime has posted `stopped`, or the owner confirms
   its wake sources are gone, or its guard reads the record (the
   manifest's `mdstack_version` is a release that includes #210). A set
   held in step 6 keeps its hold until the owner answers.
8. **Continue.** The [§6](protocol.md#6-duties-on-wake-all-roles) step 3
   sweep picks up every set at its stage. Owner-ask deadlines carry over
   unchanged; rounds keep counting.

| Live state vs manifest | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Same | Nothing moved | Adopt |
| Ahead by crew passes posted before `offered` | The drain finished work | Adopt at live state |
| A pass marker posted after `offered` or `takeover` and before `acked` | A stale run of the outgoing runtime | Do not let it satisfy anything; re-run that pass at head |
| Head moved by a non-crew actor, or state tags contradict the record | Diverged | Plan a hold; after the ack and before dispatch, hold the set (`crew:hold` with a coordinator note) and ask the owner; adopt the other sets |
| Item closed or merged | Gone | Close-out duties ([§2](protocol.md#2-stages) step 10) |
| Open crew item missing from the manifest | Missed | Adopt it through the sweep; name it in the ack |
| A run with `end` `stopped` or `kept` | Unfinished work | Re-run the pass at head; list a kept worktree for the owner, since it stays on the outgoing host |

**On tmux** (#212), `mdstack handoff reconcile` prints the plan, one line per
row above: per set `adopt`, `hold` (a head or stage tag moved since the
manifest) or `skip`, then `gone`, `rerun` (a kept or stopped run, or a
`stale` pass marker posted in transit), `missed` and `rule` differences.
`mdstack handoff ack` re-reads, refuses while a `rule` line has no owner
answer (`--rules-confirmed` once it has), and posts `acked` with the plan
once per id; after a takeover the post also carries the manifest generated
from live state. `mdstack handoff lift` removes `crew:hold` from the
`holds_added` items only once step 7 allows it; `--keep <n>` leaves a set
held in step 6.

**Idempotent.** Reconcile reads live state and writes nothing before the
ack, so a rerun after a crash gives the same result. After the ack, an item
this runtime already acted on (its own marker or claim) is skipped. Claims
are runtime-local: the incoming runtime never trusts a foreign claim file
and takes its own.

## Prompt stop

After `acked` (in a takeover: read-only at `takeover`, stop after `acked`),
every wake source of the outgoing runtime stops or no-ops within one wake
or poll interval, including one in the middle of a wait:

| Runtime | Wake sources | Stop |
|---|---|---|
| tmux | Watcher, `mdstack poll`, the Stop hook, role windows | `mdstack poll` reads the record each tick. When this runtime is no longer the owner (mode `lost`) it queues one `ownership:` wake; the watcher exits and `mdstack watch` refuses to re-arm; the coordinator runs `mdstack handoff stopped`, which re-runs itself detached from the session, disarms any watcher, runs [mdstack down](runtimes/tmux.md#mdstack-down) keeping every worktree, and posts `stopped` with the kept worktree names only once no watcher and no session remain |
| Grok Bot | Standing routines, per-PR watches B2 and V2, the dispatcher, the sweeper | Every routine's guard no-ops from its next wake. The parent turns then remove the per-PR watches and standing routines, as in [offboarding](runbook-new-repo.md#rollback-and-offboarding) step 2, and mark them removed in the wiring doc, because each no-op wake still costs a bot turn ([wiring checklist](../templates/runtimes/grok-bot/wiring.md#handoff-stop-and-return)) |
| Session (no binding yet) | The coordinator session and its subagents | The coordinator dispatches nothing more and ends its subagents; the session ends |

Then the outgoing coordinator posts `stopped`. A Grok Bot crew that keeps
its routines as no-op guards for a short switch says so in that post.

## Return path

The same flow with the roles swapped: the steps depend on which runtime
is incoming, not on the direction. A Grok Bot incoming runtime also does,
before its ack:

- **Drift check.** Rules may have changed while it was away. Deploy the
  render for the live profile and run `check-skill-drift.py --project`
  until it exits 0, as the [mirror hold gate](runtimes/grok-bot.md#mirror-hold-gate)
  requires (#128; box skills: #140).
- **Routines.** The parent turns re-create the standing routines from the
  wiring doc, then backfill B2 and V2 for every open crew PR outside the
  lighter lane, with the builder's `pass=watch` marker, as in the
  [cutover plan](../templates/runtimes/grok-bot/wiring.md#5-cutover-plan-for-open-prs)
  but with no `cutover` marker. Without the watch marker, the
  [builder watch gate](runtimes/grok-bot.md#builder-watch-gate) holds a PR
  another runtime opened.

Both checklists, stop and return, are in the Grok Bot
[wiring template](../templates/runtimes/grok-bot/wiring.md#handoff-stop-and-return).

A tmux incoming runtime starts with `mdstack up`, and runs it again after
its ack and holds (step 6) to start its leads. Its `mdstack poll` first run
records a baseline and emits nothing, so the reconcile is its sweep; the
coordinator re-creates `asks/<n>.json` for each owner ask in the manifest
so the deadline wakes fire.

## Session rules as config

Rules that lived in comment threads during the #110 run, and where each
lives instead (#157 Q3, decided by
[#160 row 15](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/160#issuecomment-6532247500)):

| Rule | Source | Config | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single-identity verdicts | #111 | One login for every role in `[identities]`; the [single-identity profile](interfaces.md#single-identity-profile) | In config |
| Standing merge grant | #111 | tmux `runtime.options.merge_grant`; the flavor knob `merge` ([flavors](flavors.md#knobs), #195) | In config (tmux) |
| `crew:hold` as a lane label | #111 | tmux `runtime.options.hold_label_blocks = false` | In config (tmux) |
| Inline-only evidence | #143 | The flavor knob `evidence = "inline"` (#195), or the protocol once #143 lands | Proposed |
| Engine order and quota steers | [Quota routing](roles.md#quota-routing) | `[engines]` | In config |
| Mirror deferral | #112, #140 | None: a temporary decision that ends with #140 | Link only |

The manifest's `rules` carries the resolved value and source of each key
above; `links` carries the rest. Each row still marked "Link only" is a gap
to close in config, not a pattern to grow.

## Runtime guards

Where each runtime runs the [guard](#ownership-record) (#157 Q4, Q5):

| Runtime | Guard placement | Read-only behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Core | [§6](protocol.md#6-duties-on-wake-all-roles) step 1, and before each push, post and land | As defined in [Ownership record](#ownership-record) |
| Grok Bot | The "Guard first" line of every routine template (B1, B2, V1, V2, S1, the after-merge routine, the dispatcher, the sweeper) and the coordinator's parent turn; one read of the control item's comments | Ends the wake in a few tool calls. The sweeper reports a lost ownership to the coordinator once per handoff id. The dispatcher no-ops every `/crew` command |
| tmux | `mdstack poll` each tick; `mdstack spawn` and `mdstack restart` refuse; the synthesizer brief before it takes the land lock; `mdstack guard` allows the stop | `mdstack poll` emits nothing but the one `ownership:` record; no window starts |
| Session | The [coordinator-session brief](../templates/runtimes/session/coordinator.md): `mdstack ownership --runtime session` at each turn and before each dispatch, push, post and land | Dispatches nothing |

The control item read needs item-level marker write and read in the
[markers interface](interfaces.md#markers), which today puts markers on
changes only; on GitHub it is an issue comment. #210 adds both operations
and the GitHub mapping.

## Tracker-native control item

Design for [#875](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/875): a
`repo.control_item` that is the tracker backend's own item id, such as
`OPS-1042`, not only a GitHub issue number. Every ownership and handoff
read and post goes through `markers.read-item` and `markers.write-item`.
Rows F1–F4 of [Build issues](#build-issues) built it: F1 (#936) the
[ID declaration](#id-declaration) and the
[control item value](#control-item-value) checks in `resolve` and
`validate`, and F2–F4 (#937, which carries #938 and #939) the bindings,
contracts, live reads and doctor row below. F2 changes what reads the
[owning-runtime gate](#ownership-record), so it lands under the
[gate contract](protocol.md#gate-contract) with the owner's merge-ok.

Every addition is optional. Without an `[ids]` declaration and with an
integer `control_item`, validation, rendered commands, posts and
`mdstack handoff` output stay as they are today. No key, marker, state tag,
command or exit code is removed or renamed.

**Before #875.** `control_item` had to be a positive integer. For a
non-GitHub markers backend, the guard put it in place of `<n>` in the
recorded `read-item` command and expected GitHub comment JSON back.
`mdstack handoff` called `gh api` for every backend: control-item reads and
posts, open items and changes, the default-branch head, review timestamps
and the hold lift.

### ID declaration

A backend map declares the shape of its ids once, in an `[ids]` table:

```toml
# <pack>/render/backends/<name>.toml
[ids]
item = "[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-[0-9]+"   # read from the tracker backend's map
change = "[0-9]+"                # read from the change backend's map (#876)
```

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Source | The map of the backend bound to `backends.tracker` gives `item`; the map bound to `backends.change` gives `change`. The map comes from the pack's `render/backends/<name>.toml`, else `templates/backends/<name>.toml`, as in the [render overlay](packs.md#render-overlay) |
| Default | An absent key is `[1-9][0-9]*`, today's GitHub number. The GitHub map declares no `[ids]` |
| Shape | A Python regular expression, used as a full match. `resolve` refuses one that does not compile or that matches an empty string, whitespace, or any of `<`, `>`, `=`, `"`, `'` and `` ` ``, so an id can never break a marker line or a command argument |
| One copy | `resolve` loads it and prints `ids.item` and `ids.change` (and the change map's `ids.marker_key` when declared) with `backend-map:<name>` provenance. Consumers (ownership, handoff, doctor, and #876's precheck keys) read the resolved value and keep no regex of their own. A profile layer cannot set `[ids]` |

### Control item value

| `control_item` | Result |
|---|---|
| Integer ≥ 1 | Accepted, as today |
| Nonempty string that fully matches `ids.item` | Accepted |
| String when the tracker map declares no `item` | Refused: `repo.control_item: a string id needs the tracker backend's [ids] item pattern` |
| String that does not match | Refused, naming the value, the pattern and the backend: `repo.control_item: "ops 1042" does not match item pattern [A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-[0-9]+ (tracker backend acme)` |
| `true`, `false`, `0`, a float or an empty string | Refused, as an integer `0` is today |

`validate` runs the check wherever it knows the tracker backend: with the
bundled GitHub map, or with `--pack-manifest` or a recorded pack. `resolve`
and so `mdstack up`, `mdstack doctor` and the renderer run it too. The
`runtime.instance` condition is unchanged.

### Placeholder `<control-item>`

The core fills `<control-item>` in a control-item command with the
configured id, as one argument after splitting the command, with no shell.
`<owner>`, `<repo>` and, for `write-item`, `<file>` are filled as well.

| The command has | Integer id | String id |
|---|---|---|
| `<control-item>` | Filled | Filled |
| Only `<n>` (a pack map written before #875) | `<n>` filled, as today | Unbound: the guard is read-only and `mdstack handoff` refuses, naming `<control-item>` |

So `<n>` never carries a native id. The GitHub map keeps `<n>` in both
item commands, because the researcher brief posts its finding on the
source issue with `write-item`, so F1 needs no change to
`templates/backends/github.toml`. Its control-item calls stay today's calls.

### Bindings

For a non-GitHub markers backend with `repo.control_item`, `mdstack up`
records the backend map's `markers.read-item` (#606) and
`markers.write-item` commands, unfilled, in `render/bindings.json`. With a
non-GitHub tracker or change backend it also records the
[live reads](#handoff-live-reads) and `tracker.unlabel`, each from the map
of its own concern's backend, and names any it cannot bind. The GitHub
markers backend keeps its built-in calls, today's
`gh api --paginate --slurp repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>/comments` read
and `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>/comments -F body=@-` post.
The ownership guard, every `mdstack handoff` action (`to`, `abort`,
`takeover`, `manifest`, `reconcile`, `ack`, `stopped`, `lift`) and
`mdstack doctor` use only those two bindings for the control item. A missing
or unmapped binding fails closed: the guard is read-only, and
`mdstack handoff` posts nothing and exits 1.

### Read-item output contract

`read-item` exits 0 and prints JSON on stdout: an array of posts, oldest
first, in the backend's post order.

```json
[{"author": "acme-bot", "body": "[Ash/handoff] claimed none → tmux@laptop (20261104-a1b2c3) ...",
  "created": "2026-11-04T17:05:00Z", "id": "10001"}]
```

| Field | Type | Required | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `author` | string | yes | Posting identity, matched against the profile's `identities` and `owners` logins. Untrusted posts are dropped before the owner function runs |
| `body` | string or null | yes | Searched for `crew:v1` lines |
| `created` | string, RFC 3339 UTC ending in `Z` | yes | Reconcile's in-transit check: a pass marker posted after the opener's `created` satisfies nothing |
| `id` | string | no | The backend's stable post id. Not read by the core today; kept for de-duplicating retries |

The core also accepts the GitHub comment shape it reads today
(`user.login`, `body`, `created_at`, `id`), either as one array or as
`--slurp` pages, and normalizes it to the fields above; there `created_at`
may be absent, as in the reads before #875, and such a post satisfies no
in-transit check. Each output is one shape or the other. A nonzero exit, invalid JSON, a mixed output or a
post missing a required field makes the record unreadable: read-only for
this wake, and `mdstack handoff` posts nothing. The owner function, the
trusted-author filter and the legal transitions are unchanged.

### Write-item contract

`write-item` takes the post body in `<file>`. Exit 0 means posted. Any
other exit is uncertain: the post may exist. The core never retries a post
blindly. It re-reads the record through `read-item`, and posts again only
while no post with the same handoff id and state exists. Stdout is ignored.

### Handoff live reads

With a non-GitHub tracker or change backend, the manifest, reconcile, ack,
stopped and lift read live state through declared operations, so the
install makes no direct GitHub call. With both on GitHub, the `gh api`
reads stay as they were. The core runs each recorded command with
`<owner>`, `<repo>`, `<default-branch>` and the row's placeholders filled,
as split arguments with no shell.

| Read before #875 (`gh api`) | Through | Output and native id handling |
|---|---|---|
| Control-item comments and posts | `markers.read-item`, `markers.write-item` | Above |
| Open items with labels, assignees, milestone and body | `tracker.list-items` | A JSON array (or pages) of items: `id` or `number`, `body`, `labels` (names or `{"name": ...}`), optional `assignees`, `milestone` and `state`; only an absent or `open` state is kept. Item ids stay strings. Dependency links match `Depends on`, `Closes`, `Fixes` and `Resolves`, followed by `#<digits>`, or by an id matching a declared `ids.item` |
| Open changes and their heads | `change.list-open`, then `change.read-head` with `<n>` per change | `list-open` prints a JSON array of changes: `id` or `number`, and the linked items as `items` (ids) or `closingIssuesReferences` (`id` or `number`). A change belongs to the first open item it links; an unlinked change is not in the manifest. `read-head` prints the full 40-character head. On GitHub the change and its issue are the same number, as before |
| Default-branch head SHA | The conditional `change.read-branch-head`, with `<branch>` | Prints the full 40-character head. `mdstack handoff` needs it only with `repo.control_item` set and a non-GitHub tracker or change backend; unbound, it refuses. The GitHub path keeps `commits/<branch>` |
| In-transit pass markers on each open change | `markers.read` with `<n>` as the change id, parsed as a read-item output | An unreadable change marker read refuses the reconcile; it never counts as "no stale marker" |
| Hold lift | The conditional `tracker.unlabel`, with `<n>` and `<tag>` = `crew:hold` | Exit 0 lifted. The map's `tracker.label` is brief text with its clear form in parentheses, so the core does not run it. Unbound or failing, `lift` stops and exits 1 |

A nonzero exit or an output that does not parse refuses the action, and
nothing is posted.

Manifest items keep schema `crew-handoff/1`. A GitHub item stays
`"#<n>"`; a native item is the id itself, such as `"OPS-12"`. An optional
`change` field names a native change id. Older readers ignore it, so the
schema major stays 1. Run records, claim names and `holds_added` carry the
same strings. A run record's item is its first reference
(`issue #10, PR #21` is `#10`; a native `issue OPS-12` is `OPS-12`), and a
change id maps to its item. A claim names its item right after `issue` or its
change right after `pr`. Item references match `ids.item` and change
references match `ids.change`, so `pr D4712` maps to its item when the two
patterns differ. `lift --keep` takes `12`, `#12` or `OPS-12`.

### Doctor

Row 22 prints the configured id as written, `OPS-1042` or `#12`, and
checks readability with the same `read-item` binding and parser as the
guard.

### Tests

The F-rows extend `dev/tests/core/test-crew-config.py`, `test-crew-ownership.py`,
`test-crew-up.py`, `test-crew-handoff.py` and `test-crew-doctor.py`. Cases:
a native string id with a fake non-GitHub `read-item` and `write-item`;
trusted and untrusted posts; a failed read; an uncertain post and its
retry; a nonempty manifest and reconcile; and unchanged GitHub
transitions, post bodies and output. The fake-backend runs put a `gh` on
`PATH` that fails the test when called, so any direct GitHub call fails.

## Quota suggestion

When [quota routing](roles.md#quota-routing) shows the owning runtime's
orchestration meter under its skip threshold (15% of the short window, 10%
of the weekly or monthly limit), the coordinator suggests a handoff to the
owner once per window: the target runtime and why. Nothing auto-applies: a
handoff is never an allowed [§6](protocol.md#6-duties-on-wake-all-roles)
default. The duty and what the suggestion carries are in
[roles](roles.md) (Quota handoff suggestion). In tmux and the session runtime
the meter is the coordinator engine's own subscription. Grok Bot gives the
crew no orchestration meter today (#109,
[Orchestration cost](roles.md#orchestration-cost)), so there the coordinator
acts only on a reading the owner gives.

## Failure cases

| Case | Handling |
|---|---|
| Outgoing runtime dies mid-drain | The owner commands a takeover; it reuses the open id |
| Incoming runtime dies before its ack | Ownership stays in transit and nobody acts. The outgoing coordinator reminds the owner; the owner restarts the incoming runtime (its reconcile is idempotent) or aborts (the outgoing runtime owns again) |
| Incoming runtime dies after its ack | It owns the repo; its normal restart reconciles from live state |
| Two runtimes claim, or two take over | The earliest marker wins; the other goes read-only |
| An offer or ack post fails | Re-read, then retry with the same id |
| The owner changes their mind | `aborted` before the ack; after it, a new handoff back |
| A stale outgoing run posts after ownership moved | The guard before each post narrows the window to seconds; reconcile re-runs any pass marker posted in transit |
| Control item unreadable | Read-only for that wake |
| The other runtime's login is not in this profile | Its markers are ignored, so the handoff fails closed; `mdstack doctor` names the login |
| Unknown manifest schema major | The incoming runtime refuses and asks the owner |

## Runtime contract

The rule is core: one owning runtime per repo, recorded on the tool of
record, read-only for every other runtime, and the land gate above. How a
runtime meets it is not: reading the record on every wake, draining its own
runs, stopping its own wake sources (a Grok Bot routine run cannot delete a
routine; a tmux watcher waits in a background command) and starting from a
manifest. C1–C8 do not cover that, so the runtime contract gains
[C9 Ownership handoff](runtimes/README.md#c9-ownership-handoff). The Grok
Bot and tmux bindings declare it unsupported today, compensated by the
manual pause, until #210–#212 close the gap.

## Build issues

The M21 issues, mapped onto this design. Rows A–E are proposed follow-ups
for the coordinator to file. Rows F1–F4 build the
[tracker-native control item](#tracker-native-control-item) (#875).

| ID | Issue | Scope from this design | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21.2 | [#210](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/210) | [Ownership record](#ownership-record): `pass=handoff` and its states in §4; the owner function; the guard at §6 step 1 and before each push, post and land; the owning-runtime gate under the gate contract (owner merge-ok); profile keys `repo.control_item` and `runtime.instance`; item-level marker operations; guard lines in the Grok Bot templates and in tmux `mdstack poll`, `spawn`, `restart`, `guard` and the synthesizer brief; tests for the owner function (claim race, one open handoff, ignored markers, unreadable record). Likely two PRs: protocol and templates (mirror), then tmux code | #157 |
| 21.3 | [#211](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/211) | [Manifest](#manifest): the template from [Manifest template](#manifest-template) and a generator `mdstack handoff manifest` (`scripts/crew.d/handoff.py`; its tests in `dev/tests/environments/test-crew-handoff.py` run under CI's `test-crew-*` glob, with no workflow edit); sets; secret scan; size rule; tests for retry (same id, same post), partial (one set held, the rest adopted) and duplicate (a second ack ignored) | #210 |
| 21.4 | [#212](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/212) | [Prompt stop](#prompt-stop) per runtime; [resume](#resume-and-reconcile) steps 1–8 and the reconcile table; lifting `holds_added`; the Grok Bot [return](#return-path) checklist; tests | #211, A |
| 21.5 | [#213](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/213) | Dry run between two full teams, tmux team a → tmux team b → team a, on a sandbox repo ([Owner assumption](#owner-assumption), [campaign A29](campaign-harness.md#a29)), recorded and linked from #157 (#157 AC3). The Grok Bot example is replaced; #140 does not block it | #212 |
| A | [#637](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/637) | Owner commands and drain: `/crew handoff to`, `drain`, `stop`, `deadline`, `abort` and `/crew takeover from` in §9 as chat commands; the `draining` state per runtime | #210 |
| B | [#638](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/638) | Session runtime guard: the coordinator-session brief carries the guard and the outgoing and incoming steps until the session binding that [bootstrap](bootstrap.md#build-issues) proposes exists | #210 |
| C | [#639](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/639) | `mdstack doctor` rows: control item set and readable, `runtime.instance` set, current owning runtime (a scope note for #190) | #210, #190 |
| D | [#640](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/640) | Quota suggestion in the coordinator's duties | #212, #109 |
| E | proposed | Contract tables: C9 rows in the [multi-device](runtimes/multi-device.md#runtime-contract-across-hosts) design, and the session binding's table | #212 |
| F1 | [#936](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/936) | [Tracker-native control item](#tracker-native-control-item): the `[ids]` declaration loaded by `resolve`; `control_item` as an integer or a matching string; the `<control-item>` placeholder; `scripts/crew-config.py`, `scripts/crew-render.py` | #875 |
| F2 | [#937](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/937) | Read-item and write-item bindings and contracts for the ownership guard and every control-item read and post in `mdstack handoff`; `scripts/crew.d/_ownership.py`, `up.py`, `handoff.py`. Changes what reads the owning-runtime gate: owner merge-ok | #936 |
| F3 | [#938](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/938) | `mdstack handoff` live reads through declared operations and native ids in the manifest; `change.read-branch-head` | #937 |
| F4 | [#939](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/939) | Remaining reconcile, ack and lift consumers (run records, claims, `holds_added`) and the doctor row | #938 |

## Out of scope

- The dry run (#157 AC3) is #213, run as [campaign A29](campaign-harness.md#a29)
  between two tmux teams ([Owner assumption](#owner-assumption)).
- Switching without the owner; the quota trigger only suggests.
- Building any of this before the build issues land.
- Two runtimes acting on one repo, even on separate items.
- Moving unlanded worktrees between hosts: they stay where they are, and
  the manifest names them for the owner.

## Design credit

Read-only fallback for a second session, dependency-closed idempotent
transfer, retry until receipt with a stable id and a take-over that stops
the old watcher at once are adapted from
[firstmate](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate) (MIT license), as
decided in #160 row 16. mdstack takes the contracts only: no code or text
is copied. Not adopted: a local outbox file as the record (row 16 #7) and
a session lock per home.
