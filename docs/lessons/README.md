# Lessons log

Dated record of what the crew learned from pilots, incidents and bottleneck
reviews. Each lesson is written down here first, then turned into an issue and a
PR (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)).

Repeated small smells go to the findings buffer, [docs/findings/](../findings/README.md),
first and are batched into one issue (the M5 batch), not one lesson each.
Lessons stay for incidents that have a written analysis.

Entries are sanitized per spec R1: no tokens, keys, email addresses, private chat
quotes or real box paths. Use placeholders (`<state-dir>`, `<owner>/<repo>`) and
bot role names (coordinator, builder, reviewer-validator, synthesizer).

## File naming

One file per analysis or incident: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, where the date is when
the analysis was done. A file holds one or more entries.

## Entry format

Every entry uses these fields, in this order. A file may group related entries
under a table or a list, but each entry still answers every field.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Date | When the lesson was observed or written up (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| Source / evidence | Where the finding comes from: the pilot, PR, timeline or analysis. Sanitized; worked-example references are plain text, not links |
| Finding | What happened, in one or two sentences |
| Impact | The cost, in time, rounds or risk. Give a number only when the source gives one |
| Fix | The change that addresses it, or the proposed change |
| Status | `encoded` (a check in `scripts/check-repo.py` or lint enforces the fix; name the check in Fix), `applied` (the fix is in effect: it is in the protocol, role docs, templates or scripts on `main`, or the source confirms it live), `superseded` (replaced by a different fix or entry; name it) or `open` (not applied, only proposed, an accepted limit, or the evidence does not settle it). Follow the status word with a short reason that names the evidence, such as a file, section or PR. Never guess |
| Linked issue/PR | The issue or PR in this repo that tracks the fix, or `none yet` |

Template:

```markdown
### <short title>

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Source / evidence:** <where it comes from>
- **Finding:** <what happened>
- **Impact:** <cost>
- **Fix:** <change>
- **Status:** open | applied | superseded | encoded
- **Linked issue/PR:** none yet | <owner>/<repo>#N
```

### Status vocabulary

One vocabulary: `encoded`, `applied`, `superseded`, `open`. It replaces the
earlier `shipped` and `documented`, which both map onto `applied`; the evidence after
the word says where the fix lives (for example "`docs/roles.md` Quota routing"
or "box configuration, per the source"). A fix the docs prescribe is `applied`
once it is on `main`. Whether a box skill copy matches is a separate question,
answered by the
[drift check](../../scripts/README.md#skill-drift-check-coordinator).

Hygiene pass: when a PR changes a protocol, role or template rule that a lesson
describes, re-check that lesson's status in the same PR. Verify against `main`
(`docs/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, merged PRs); if the evidence
does not settle it, keep `open` and say why.

## Correction hierarchy

When a lesson needs a fix, fix it at the highest level that works, and write
prose last:

1. **Architecture:** remove the failure mode by design, so the step cannot go
   wrong or no longer exists.
2. **Types / schemas:** make the bad state unrepresentable, for example a fixed
   marker format with one required field shape.
3. **Lint:** a linter rule (markdownlint and similar) catches it.
4. **CI check:** a check in `scripts/check-repo.py`, with a failing-then-passing
   test in `scripts/test-check-repo.py`, catches it before merge.
5. **Skill or protocol prose:** a written rule. Last resort, because prose is
   only followed when someone reads it.

Each entry's **Fix** names the level it uses. A fix at level 5 must say
**"prose only, because ..."** and give the reason. That exception is allowed
only when the rule cannot be checked from repo files: it depends on live
GitHub state, timing, bot behaviour or judgement. "It was quicker to write a
sentence" is not a reason.

Status `encoded` means a structural check enforces the fix (level 4 or above)
and the Fix names it; it is a stronger form of `applied`. Prose written
alongside the check stays, but the check is what holds the line. Existing entries keep their status until someone encodes
them; encoding every lesson is not required.
