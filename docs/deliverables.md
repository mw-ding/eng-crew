# Deliverables and versioning (design)

> - **Status:** built
> - **Applies to:** every release bundle from `v2.0.0`
> - **Current rules:** [protocol](protocol.md); release gate in the [gate registry](protocol.md#gate-registry)
> - **Built:** [Inventory](#inventory) as `scripts/deliverables.txt`, [Packaging](#packaging) by `scripts/release-bundle.py` (#236), [Versioning](#versioning) and [First versions](#first-versions) (#219)
> - **Design only:** further harness layouts as render targets ([Packaging](#packaging)), decided in [bootstrap](bootstrap.md#q4-install-targets)

What eng-crew ships, how it is packaged, how it is versioned and what each
version promises (roadmap R1.1,
[#145](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/145); umbrella
[#110](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/110);
[portable spec P9](specs/portable.md#2-requirements)). How a version is cut
and taken is in [release.md](release.md).

This page adds no rule, gate, cap, marker field or label; the
[protocol](protocol.md) owns them. The bundle build
([#236](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/236)) and the release
workflow with the bundle attach
([#218](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/218),
[#246](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/246)) are implemented
([release.md](release.md)).

## Terms

- **Deliverable:** a path an environment installs or loads at run time (a
  role reads it, a script runs, the renderer consumes it). Deliverables are
  the public surface that [versioning](#versioning) covers.
- **Internal:** a path only maintainers of this repo use. Changing it never
  changes the version number.
- **Source / generated:** this repo holds only source. Rendered briefs and
  routines, and the release bundle, are generated and never committed
  (golden test fixtures excepted).

## Inventory

Every tracked path falls in exactly one row. Runtime `all` means every
runtime; `grok-bot`, `tmux` and `session` are the
[runtime bindings](runtimes/README.md). The table is generated from
[`scripts/deliverables.txt`](../scripts/deliverables.txt), one row per manifest
row (a row may be a glob), so the manifest is the source and no PR edits the
table by hand: add or change a manifest row at its sorted place, then run
`python3 scripts/check-repo.py --fix`. `check-repo.py` fails on a stale table
and on an unsorted manifest, which would bring back the append point every PR
conflicts on ([#325](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/325)).

<!-- inventory:end -->

Coordinator session helpers are not in the repo yet; they become
deliverables once upstreamed ([release.md](release.md#upstreaming-the-session-tooling)).

Issue templates: this repo's own `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (the intake card)
stays internal with `.github/**`. Product-repo issue templates would be
deliverables under `templates/`.

A new tracked path must be classified when it lands: the manifest is the
machine-readable source of this table, and the bundle build and the repo guard
fail on an unclassified path ([release.md](release.md#follow-up-issues)).

## Packaging

| Decision | Choice | Alternatives considered |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | One bundle per release, `eng-crew-<version>.tar.gz`, holding every deliverable at its repo path, plus `VERSION` and `SHA256SUMS` | One tarball per runtime: more build and install paths for a few small files; revisit when a runtime's files outgrow this. A committed `dist/<runtime>/` tree: generated files in git drift, the same problem as hand mirroring |
| Per-runtime selection | At install: the renderer reads only the profile's `runtime.name` inputs, so one bundle serves every runtime | Rendering per runtime at release time: the render needs project values (`repo.owner`, identities, paths), which only the install has |
| Rendered output | Generated at install by `crew-render.py` from the bundle and the resolved profile, then deployed and drift-checked ([#128](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/128)) | Shipping a reference render of `profiles/default.toml`: its values are placeholders, so it adds nothing over the templates |
| Harness layouts (Claude Code subagents and skills, Codex prompts, Grok Bot box skills) | Future render targets of the same bundle, decided by bootstrap ([#144](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/144) install targets) | A Claude Code plugin as the release unit: one harness only |
| Links | A relative link from a deliverable to an internal path is rewritten to the file at the release tag on GitHub, so the bundle has no broken link and stays small | Shipping lessons and specs: they are history, not rules |
| Source archive | GitHub's automatic source archive of the tag stays available for a full checkout | none |

`scripts/crew` is an entry point plus per-command modules in `scripts/crew.d/`
([#224](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/224)); the bundle ships the
whole module directory, so the split changes no packaging rule.

## Versioning

SemVer, tagged `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (owner decision, R1 milestone). The
release id is what `release.record-release` writes
([release operations](release.md#release-operations)): a tag here, or, for a
project with `release_id = "commit"` in its
[`[release]` table](profile.md#release), the full 40-character hash of the
landed cut commit ([commit release id](release.md#commit-release-id)). The
version number and the rules below are the same for both. The
public surface is the deliverables above. A change is breaking when an
environment installed at the previous version, or a pack pinned to it, would
stop working or stop complying without edits.

| Bump | Change to a deliverable |
|---|---|
| Major | A [§7](protocol.md#7-merge-gate-synthesizer) merge gate or the release gate added, removed, or satisfied differently; a `crew:v1` marker field removed, renamed, newly required or changed in meaning; a `crew:*` state tag removed, renamed or changed in meaning; a profile key removed, renamed, newly required or retyped; a pack manifest field or [interface](interfaces.md) operation removed or newly required; a runtime contract capability newly required; a `crew` command or flag removed, or a changed exit code or parsed output; a render placeholder removed or renamed |
| Minor | An optional profile key with a default; a new optional marker field old readers ignore; a new command, flag, template, script, runtime or backend binding; a new role duty that adds no gate |
| Patch | A fix that restores documented behaviour; wording that changes no rule; docs and test-only changes to deliverables |
| None | Any change to internal paths only |

Rules:

- A breaking CHANGELOG entry starts with `**Breaking:**` and carries a
  one-line migration step. The entries since the last tag decide the
  smallest allowed bump; the release approver checks the cut PR's version
  against them ([release.md](release.md#steps)).
- Pre-release versions (`vX.Y.Z-rc.N`) are allowed for a smoke run and never
  satisfy a pin, whatever the release id.
- Only the latest release is supported. Fixes go forward as a new release;
  there are no backport branches unless the owner asks for one.

## Compatibility promise

| To | Promise |
|---|---|
| Packs ([#127](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/127)) | The [version pin](packs.md#version-pin) rule is unchanged: a pack is supported at its pinned version. Once tags exist the pin is a tag, not a SHA; under a commit release id the pin is the recorded hash. Within one major, a manifest and pack profile that pass `validate` and `resolve` at the pin also pass at any later minor or patch, so moving the pin inside a major needs no pack edit |
| Installed environments ([#144](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/144)) | Within one major, upgrading is re-render, drift check, deploy, with no profile edit. Across a major, the `**Breaking:**` entries list every edit the profile, pack or live copy needs |
| Live roles | A role's behaviour changes only when its environment takes a new version; nothing auto-updates ([release.md](release.md#update-path)) |

| Tag | Commit | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `v1.0.0` | The M12 cut: the commit that locked the README "v1 cut" (candidate `b2144a28198f26f6dc6cc0a8b2135a1e38d852ba`, PR #95; [#219](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/219) confirms it) | Retro-tag of M1–M12 |
| `v2.0.0` | The M14 cut, after the [#139](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/139) smoke | Major: M13/M14 change the profile layout, the runtime and the gates (the mirror gate is now a drift check), all breaking under the table above |

No `v1.x` release is cut between them. `v1.0.0` has no bundle (the bundle
build lands later); its source archive is the artifact.
