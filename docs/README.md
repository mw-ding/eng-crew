# Docs index

This is the index for the engineering-bot crew framework docs. Start with the
architecture overview, then read the protocol and the role details.

The framework is generic. Per-repo values appear as placeholders such as
`<owner>`, `<repo>`, `<author-login>` and `<reviewer-login>`. No secrets or
tokens are stored in this repo.

## Find your path

Navigation only: these links point at the docs that own each rule and add no
rule of their own. A role's rendered brief stays its operating instruction.

By role:

- **Owner:** [../README.md](../README.md) for the product and install front
  page and its [Quickstart](../README.md#quickstart-tmux), then [flavors.md](flavors.md) for rigor and
  [protocol.md](protocol.md) for steering and the decisions it asks of you.
- **Adopter:** the [Quickstart](../README.md#quickstart-tmux) for a tmux
  crew, then [runbook-new-repo.md](runbook-new-repo.md) by chosen runtime,
  then [bootstrap.md](bootstrap.md), [profile.md](profile.md),
  [release.md](release.md) and the runtime binding
  ([runtimes/tmux.md](runtimes/tmux.md) or
  [runtimes/grok-bot.md](runtimes/grok-bot.md)).
- **Pack author:** [concepts.md](concepts.md), then
  [interfaces.md](interfaces.md) and [runtimes/README.md](runtimes/README.md),
  then [profile.md](profile.md) and [roles-registry.md](roles-registry.md),
  then [packs.md](packs.md) and the selected binding.
- **Coordinator:** [protocol.md](protocol.md), the coordinator sections of
  [roles.md](roles.md), the runtime binding, [scheduling.md](scheduling.md)
  and [self-improve.md](self-improve.md).
- **Builder:** [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), the worker brief and PR
  templates in [roles.md](roles.md), [verification.md](verification.md) and
  [../templates/evidence/](../templates/evidence/README.md); add
  [express-lane.md](express-lane.md) for an express change.
- **Reviewer-validator:** [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), the review sections of
  [protocol.md](protocol.md), [roles.md](roles.md) and
  [verification.md](verification.md).
- **Synthesizer:** the stage 7 merge gate in [protocol.md](protocol.md), the
  runtime binding's land procedure and [release.md](release.md) for cuts.
- **Researcher:** the Researcher section of [roles.md](roles.md) and the
  docs the request names.

By task:

- **Change the framework:** [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md),
  [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [../scripts/](../scripts/README.md).
- **Understand the flow:** [architecture.md](architecture.md), then
  [concepts.md](concepts.md); diagram sources are in
  [diagrams/](diagrams/README.md).
- **Look up history:** [lessons/README.md](lessons/README.md),
  [findings/README.md](findings/README.md),
  [../CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) and the specs under [specs/](specs/portable.md).
- **Read metrics:** [metrics/README.md](metrics/README.md) and
  [metrics/decisions.md](metrics/decisions.md).

## Available now

Audience: O owner, A adopter, P pack author, C coordinator, B builder, V
reviewer-validator, S synthesizer, R researcher; `all` means every one. Kind:
`rule` (normative: stages, gates, contracts), `reference` (schemas,
inventories, runbooks, overviews), `design` (proposal or build plan, possibly
partly built) or `history` (dated record, not a current rule). A doc with two
kinds mixes them; lifecycle status stays in each doc.

<!-- Keep the rows sorted by the first cell, one row per doc (check-repo.py checks both); a new doc's row goes at its sorted place, not at the end. -->

## Planned

Nothing is planned right now. Every doc in the spec's slices has landed and is
listed under Available now.

## Documentation principles

Owner-approved on 2026-11-04 for editing these docs. They guide how a doc is
written, moved or split and add no rule, gate, marker or default of their
own. The full design, with reasons and rejected alternatives, is
[Riley's design on #676](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/676#issuecomment-6638520989);
the approval and principle 11 are in the
[decision record](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/676#issuecomment-6640367783).

1. **One authored definition per rule.** Each rule lives in one owner
   section carrying all its conditions and exceptions; other mentions link to
   it, and examples illustrate without redefining. Why: copies drift into
   competing instructions.
2. **Ownership follows topic, not reader.** A role page links to the topic
   owner below instead of becoming a second owner. Why: role views repeat
   rules for every reader.
3. **Lifecycle is evidence-backed and scoped.** A design page states
   `design`, `partly built`, `built` or `superseded` under its H1, with scope,
   current-rule links, evidence and a last-checked date or SHA; kind stays
   separate. Why: readers must tell shipped mechanisms from proposals.
4. **Structural consolidation preserves behaviour.** A move or dedup changes
   no rule, gate, marker, default or runtime support, shows source-to-target
   correspondence and files a contradiction as its own correction issue. Why:
   review checks preservation, and no cleanup silently picks a winning rule.
5. **Executable copies have a different boundary.** Generated includes and
   instructions a brief needs to run may stay copied; other handwritten policy
   copies are tracked debt with an owner and follow-up. Why: a required
   instruction must not become an optional link.
6. **Reading paths separate start, every wake and triggers.** Navigation
   gives exact links for each, adds no duty or waiver and keeps conditional
   material off unrelated paths. Why: neither full rereads every wake nor
   summaries that drop mandatory checks.
7. **New files stay packaged and reachable.** A new doc gets its manifest
   row, generated inventory row and index row; prefer existing sections. Why:
   an unclassified file fails checks or drops out of bundles.
8. **Sensitivity survives structural-only status.** A move touching a
   sensitive path still needs `crew:sensitive` and per-change owner merge-ok.
   Why: unchanged wording in a new place can still change gate reading.
9. **Sequence by dependencies and changed hunks.** Aim near 100 authored
   changed lines per PR, under 200 where practical, counting both sides of a
   move; serialize overlapping hunks. Why: small, ordered slices review well
   and avoid parallel rewrites.
10. **Guardrails prove mechanics, not meaning.** Green `check-repo.py` and
    link checks do not prove fragments, ownership or preserved meaning; keep
    old anchors and check destination headings by hand. Why: the checks do not
    cover those.
11. **Modular organization.** One concern per file, with boundaries that
    follow the ownership map. An oversized multi-concern doc is split over
    time; its original path stays as a stable entry point with its old
    anchors kept as link targets, cross-module references are links only, and
    each split is a section-sized move under principles 4, 7, 8 and 9. Why:
    cohesive modules are easier to own, read and change.
