# Profile install

Onboarding module for installing the crew from a profile with
`mdstack bootstrap`, split out of the [onboarding runbook](../runbook-new-repo.md)
under the M26 modular organization principle
([#676](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/676)). It is the
recommended path of the runbook's
[Step 0: write, validate and render the profile](../runbook-new-repo.md#step-0-write-validate-and-render-the-profile),
after the [Prerequisites](../runbook-new-repo.md#prerequisites), and holds its
[manual fallback](#manual-fallback). The onboarding Steps 1–8 stay in the
runbook.

## Bootstrap (recommended)

Start with an extracted, checksum-verified release bundle from
[README: Install](../../README.md#install), or a checkout at an exact stable
release tag. Use a release that includes `mdstack bootstrap`; check
`<eng-crew>/cli/mdstack bootstrap --help`. An untagged development checkout
requires `--dev`, records its commit SHA and satisfies no version pin.

Write `<project>/crew.toml` using item 1 of the
[manual fallback](#manual-fallback). For tmux, use
[Set up the target repo](../runbook-new-repo.md#set-up-the-target-repo) for the runtime-specific
profile values. Set every path used by the install to a real path; for tmux,
`paths.eng_crew` must be `<state-dir>/<owner>__<repo>/eng-crew`, the link
bootstrap creates to the bundle. Use an absolute project-file path:

```bash
<eng-crew>/cli/mdstack bootstrap --project <project>/crew.toml --dry-run
<eng-crew>/cli/mdstack bootstrap --project <project>/crew.toml
```

Pass `--org-profile <pack>/profile.toml` to both commands if a pack applies.
Review the render diff, target paths and human steps before confirming apply.
In a non-interactive shell, use `--yes` only after reviewing the dry run.
A failed preflight stops the install; follow its hints, use
`<eng-crew>/cli/mdstack doctor --project <project>/crew.toml --fix` for
missing state directories, then retry. Never overwrite a tracked, edited or
unowned target to get past a refusal.

Capture the dry-run and apply output. Expect `crew bootstrap: dry-run; no
install written`, then `crew bootstrap: installed <path-to-install.json>`.
Apply records `VERSION`, `install.json`, a profile copy and the `eng-crew`
link in the shared state directory. Grok Bot receives the deployed render at
`paths.live_dir`; tmux receives a render preview, with deployment and hooks
left to `mdstack up`. See [bootstrap](../bootstrap.md) for the design and build slices.

Complete Steps 1–5 and the remaining wiring in [Step 6](../runbook-new-repo.md#step-6-state-dir-and-wiring-doc).
The current core does not automate labels, collaborator acceptance, Milestones,
Project setup, protection choices or the end-to-end smoke test. Record every
pending human step from the install manifest. Bootstrap does not start roles:
create Grok Bot routines in [Step 7](../runbook-new-repo.md#step-7-listener-wiring-per-bot), or run
`mdstack up` for [tmux](../runbook-new-repo.md#run-the-crew), then complete Step 8 and the checklist.

## Manual fallback

Use these steps when the installed release lacks bootstrap or bootstrap cannot
run. The same prerequisites, product-safety checks and verification checklist
apply; record the fallback and its reason in `wiring.md`.

Needs Python 3.11+ and a checkout of this repo (`<path-to-this-repo>`); run
the commands from its root; `crew.toml` below stands for the path to your
profile file. Usage of both scripts:
[scripts: Profile validator](../../scripts/README.md#profile-validator) and
[Renderer](../../scripts/README.md#renderer).

1. **Write `crew.toml`.** Copy [profiles/default.toml](../../profiles/default.toml)
   (GitHub for every concern, Grok Bot runtime) and replace every `<...>`
   value: `repo.owner`, `repo.name`, `repo.default_branch`, the logins in
   `[identities]` from [Identities](../runbook-new-repo.md#identities) (`owners` are the user's own
   logins; `reviewer.gh_user` must differ from the other three), the bot
   display names, `runtime.timezone`, and `[paths]` with the
   [shared state dir](../runbook-new-repo.md#shared-state-dir), the worker worktree root and the
   [toolchain](../runbook-new-repo.md#other-prerequisites) `PATH` entry. Keep the `[engines]` routing
   unless the owner chose otherwise. Every key is in
   [profile.md: Keys](../profile.md#keys).

2. **Validate** the file on its own:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/crew-config.py validate crew.toml
   ```

   Expect exit 0. Each problem prints as `file:key: reason`. A value still
   written as a placeholder passes validation, so also check
   `grep -n '<' crew.toml` prints nothing.

3. **Resolve** the layers (core defaults, the default profile, your file):

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/crew-config.py resolve --project crew.toml
   ```

   Expect `crew-config: OK` and one `key = value  # layer` line per key, with
   no `<...>` value left (a key you deleted falls back to the default profile's
   placeholder). Capture the output: it is the value list for every command
   below. Add `--org-profile <path>` only if an org pack applies
   ([Layers and precedence](../profile.md#layers-and-precedence)).

4. **Render** the role briefs and runtime artifacts:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/crew-render.py --project crew.toml --out <out-dir>
   ```

   `--inputs` defaults to the real input tree, `templates/` (the Grok Bot
   templates and `backends/github.toml`). Expect `crew-render: OK (<k> files)`
   and the written paths: the Grok Bot routines under `runtime/` (role briefs
   under `briefs/` only once the input tree has `core/`). On any problem it
   prints `file:line: reason` and writes nothing. The parity check
   `python3 dev/tests/core/test-render-parity.py` proves the rendered default profile
   equals the template text
   ([scripts: Renderer](../../scripts/README.md#renderer)).

**Hand-fill fallback.** Without rendered routines (if the renderer cannot
run), copy each template under
`templates/runtimes/grok-bot/` ([templates](../../templates/README.md)) and replace each install-time placeholder with its resolved value from item 3
([templates: Placeholders](../../templates/README.md#placeholders)). Record in
the wiring doc which path was used.
