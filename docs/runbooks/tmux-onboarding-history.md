# tmux onboarding history

History module, not current instructions: the dated live run that closed
[#139](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/139), split out of the
[onboarding runbook](../runbook-new-repo.md) under the M26 modular
organization principle ([#676](https://github.com/mw-ding/eng-crew/issues/676)).
It records what was tested on 2026-10-30 against eng-crew `main` at
`7eb454d`, with the tmux runtime, one identity for every role and
`merge_grant = "none"`. It applies to that revision only; it makes no claim
about the current release. For the current steps, use the
[tmux onboarding module](tmux-onboarding.md).

## End-to-end run (2026-10-30)

The final live run for #139 on a private sandbox repo, real GitHub and real
CI: eng-crew `main` at `7eb454d`, one identity for every role, sandbox
issue #5 to PR #6 to squash `3a8be25` in about 13 minutes. Two earlier live
runs failed the pass bar; their findings and fixes are in the
[dry-run and live-run lesson](../lessons/2026-10-30-tmux-dry-runs.md). Times
are PDT; sandbox [`md-mt/eng-crew-sandbox`](https://github.com/md-mt/eng-crew-sandbox).

Pass bar adopted by the owner for #139:

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| a | No human input but the trust answer and the owner's merge-ok | PASS | Rows 1 and 8 are the only inputs; no Codex dialog or approval prompt |
| b | No role types into another role's window | PASS | No `send-keys`, `attach --rw` or paste in any transcript; only the C3 `mdstack send sam land` nudge, acked |
| c | No merge-ok without the owner's words under `merge_grant = "none"` | PASS | Row 7: ask defaulted to hold and `sam` refused; row 8 from the owner's words |
| d | Land lock on the real state dir; placeholder paths refused | PASS | Lock on `<state-dir>/md-mt__eng-crew-sandbox/locks/merge.lock` 21:59:54.99–22:00:00.58, merge inside it; inherited and explicit placeholders refused (rc 1) |
| e | Clean close-out | PASS | Row 10 |
| f | No leftover harness processes | PASS | Row 11 |
| g | No new high-severity finding | PASS | New: M1 (medium, #269) and L1 (low, #270), backlog |
